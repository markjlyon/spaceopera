## 12703.02.01
The Deep Space Signal Detection Array detected a general distress call on all subspace channels in old Imperial Zendai.
The USC rushed into action with the entire fleet in a matter of minutes, but only found an oblitered Imperial Zendai Battlecruiser at the source of the transmission.
There were no survivors.
No data could be recovered as the ship's AI destroyed itself and all data including backups.
It remains a mystery where the ship came from or how it came to be located so deeply in Invader occupied space.
