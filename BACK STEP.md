# PROJECT BACK STEP

## OPERATION
The BACKSTEP project is the most classified secret in the USC. It allows the USC to send one person back in time 5 days. The USC uses this technology in the interest of USC galactic security.

### COMMAND STRUCTURE
Due to the extreme need for secrecy, the number of personnel working on the BACKSTEP project is very small and it's members tightly controlled.

Several Ships Made Flesh represent the "council" that determines the need for a BACKSTEP. This is because advanced AIs are not vulnerable to technological or psionic attacks. Tia, Bismark, Dominique, Harmony, and Kyrie all vote on each BACKSTEP and a 4/5ths majority is needed for approval. In cases where one or more Ship Made Flesh are killed in action or unavailable to vote, their vote is automatically in favor of a BACKSTEP.

Commander Olympia Tzimisce is the project director and has broad authority to use her telepathic abilities in service of BACKSTEP operations, even if the use of her powers violates USC law. She views herself as BACKSTEP Director first, and USC Military PSICorps member second.

Nathan Sherman is in charge of BACKSTEP security and intelligence. He is a Drago-Kadsai Zendai.

Doctor Morris Watts handles all research for BACKSTEP, theoretical development, and temporal coordinate calculations. He is an older USC radiation cluster survivor.

Doctor Saoirse Delaplane handles all medical and psychological issues for the chrononauts, she is also a trained backup for temporal coordinate calculations and BACKSTEP launch operations. She is a Conclave Zendai.

Toff Garnet handles the engineering, systems repair, and improvements of the BACKSTEP program. He can also perform coordinate calculations and launch operations. He is a USC engineer who "died" in the line of duty. His wife, Rose, is a Sabra Courtesan, and they never desire to leave the BACKSTEP facilities. He knows and doesn't care if she's a courtesan.

Nicholas Forrest is the only living chrononaut. He is a Daear jaunter with a high pain threshold and possesses photographic memory. His jaunt range is currently unknown.

### ENIGMA
Chrononauts are sent into the past with highly secure information about the mission with all the intelligence they gathered up to the moment of the BACKSTEP. Sometimes this information is complete, sometimes there is very little information, and rarely there is none. The chrononaut also possesses an unforgeable programmable matter deposit in the form of a tattoo as well as a hidden memory area only very powerful telepaths can access so their identity can be confirmed. 

Once a BACKSTEP is performed the chrononaut makes contact using the keyword ENIGMA to alert personnel that a mission is active. Once their identity is confirmed, Tzimisce hands command over to the chrononaut and their word on the mission is final.

### TEMPORAL CENSORSHIP
A chrononaut that performs a BACKSTEP is temporally censored for a period of 5 days, starting from the moment they arrive in the past until they reach the same point in time that they initiated the BACKSTEP.

Temporal censorship prevents any technology  or psionic powers from seeing the chrononaut or their events during the entire temporal censorship period. 

### TEMPORAL DECOHERENCE
A chrononaut that performs a BACKSTEP suffers from termporal decoherence for a period of 5 days, starting from the moment they arrive in the past until they reach the same point in time they initiated the BACKSTEP.

Temporal decoherence causes changes to the new timeline due to the arrival of the chrononaut. These changes are unpredictable but never result in eliminating the need for the BACKSTEP. Many events that happened in the previous timeline leading up to the BACKSTEP may have changed, including a coin toss result, which teams win a sporting event, or which tree was struck by lightning. Only events during the temporal decoherence are affected.

### TEMPORAL SIGNIFICANCE
Every object, being, and event in a timeline has a temporal significance that indicates how much the future relies on that object, being, or event. This temporal significance can be detected by specialized devices and some beings from different dimensions or timelines.

Temporal significance ratings detemine the damage caused to the timeline and its parallels if the object or being does not continue to sit in its proper spacetime and are measured with a value between 0 to 1000, with 0 usually representing something or someone from outside the current timeline while 1000 representing something or someone the future is absolutely dependent upon.

Ratings vary greatly and objects and beings have ratings that might seem counter intuitive. A old coin might have a temporal significance rating of 891 while the leader of a planet that ended slavery might only have a temporal significance rating of 117. 

### 5 DAYS
Due to the limits of available fuel and size of the temporal reactor, each BACKSTEP is limited to 5.012 standard USC days.

### PILOT
The chrononaut and their past self merge upon their arrival to the past, causing the past self to "disappear" leaving only chrononaut. There are never two instances of the chrononaut. This is one way to identify a BACKSTEP has occurred even if the chrononaut hasn't made contact. The health of the chrononaut can be based entirely on the future version, entirely on the past version, or somewhere in between. So far it has been impossible to determine in advance and is believed to have something to do with temporal decoherence. Since the chrononaut is usually injured during the BACKSTEP it can be significant if both the past and future versions are injured, as the chrononaut will usually be in fairly bad shape upon arrival.

### DODECAHEDRON
The dodecahedron merges with it's past self and becomes one in the same manner as a chrononaut at the landing coordinates. There are never two instances of the dodecahedron. The disappearance of the dodecahedron is a clear sign a BACKSTEP has occurred, unless the BACKSTEP arrived at the same location as the past dodecahedron.

The core temporal plate pairs at the top and bottom of the dodecahedron are indestructable allowing them to be retrieved in cases of catastrophe. The dodecahedron vehicle shell and pilot cockpit area on not so fortunate.

### FUEL
There is limited fuel for the BACKSTEP dodecahedron reactor with no known way to acquire or make more, so each use of a BACKSTEP must be solely for the purposes of the survival of the USC.

Recently an additional fuel source was discovered which increases the number of BACKSTEP missions that can be undertaken by a significant number, allowing more flexibility in mission selection without requiring each mission to be about the survival of the USC as a whole.

~~OOC NOTE:
High powered Inanimate Matter Manipulators with high a hgih enough rating can produce this fuel, but no one has thought of this before because no one has been powerful enough to try up until now.~~

### TEMPORAL MORTALITY
While on a mission the chrononaut is outside of the normal timestream until they return to their normal timestream. So if a chrononaut travels back 5 days, he will be outside of the normal timestream until he returns to the time when he made the BACKSTEP. During this time if the chrononaut dies he is dead. a different chrononaut can't go back and save him or stop him from going on the mission to prevent his death. No matter what happens, he will die at exactly the same date and time. Once he reenters the timestream at his departure point, he can be affected like everyone else including being saved from death by another chrononaut.
