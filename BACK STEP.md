# PROJECT BACK STEP

## OPERATION
The BACKSTEP project allows the USC to send one person back in time, 5 days. There are some operational rules and consequences for backsteps.

### TEMPORAL CENSORSHIP
A chrononaut can't backstep more than once to the same period in the past.

### THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT
Travelling into the past causes minor things to change, so it is impossible to benefit in the past with knowledge of the future. This applies primarily to unplanned events like sports and games of chance. Deliberate actions generally remain the same.

Having said that, some events appear impossible to prevent or alter. If you try to interrupt someone before they make a great scientific discovery, whatever sparked that moment of realization will still happen but in a different way. This is true for many things the stability of the future depends upon, like the discovery of the transistor or fusion reactors.

### TEMPORAL SIGNIFICANCE
Every thing and event in a timeline has a temporal signature that determines how much the future relies on that thing or event. This signature can only be detected by devices or beings from different times.

Temporal significance is measured in ratings between 0-1000.

### 5 DAYS
Due to the limits of available fuel and size of the reactor, backsteps are limited to 5 days.

### PILOT
The chrononaut and their past self will merge upon arrival to the past, causing the past self to "disappear" with only the chrononaut self existing. There can't be two instances of a chrononaut.

### DODECAHEDRON
The dodecahedron merges with it's past self and becomes one in the same manner as a chrononaut. There can't be two instances of a dodecahedron.

### FUEL
There is limited fuel for the backstep dodecahedron with no known why to get or make more, so the use of a backstep must be for critical purposes only.

High powered Inanimate Matter Manipulators can produce this fuel, but no one has thought of this before because no one has been powerful enough to try.
