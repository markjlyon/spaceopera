# PROJECT BACK STEP

## OPERATION
The BACKSTEP project is the most classified secret in the USC. It allows the USC to send one person back in time 5 days. The USC uses this technology in the interest of USC galactic security.

### COMMAND STRUCTURE
Due to the extreme need for secrecy, the number of personnel working on the BACKSTEP project is very small and it's members tightly controlled.

Several Ships Made Flesh represent the "council" that determines the need for a BACKSTEP. This is because advanced AIs are not vulnerable to technological or psionic attacks. Tia, Bismark, Dominique, Harmony, and Kyrie all vote on each BACKSTEP and a 4/5ths majority is needed for approval. In cases where one or more Ship Made Flesh are killed in action or unavailable to vote, their vote is automatically in favor of a BACKSTEP.

Commander Olympia Tzimisce is the project director and has broad authority to use her telepathic abilities in service of BACKSTEP operations, even if the use of her powers violates USC law. She views herself as BACKSTEP Director first, and USC Military PSICorps member second.

Nathan Sherman is in charge of BACKSTEP security and intelligence. He is a Drago-Kadsai Zendai.

Doctor Morris Watts handles all research for BACKSTEP, theoretical development, and temporal coordinate calculations. He is an older USC radiation cluster survivor.

Doctor Saoirse Delaplane handles all medical and psychological issues for the chrononauts, she is also a trained backup for temporal coordinate calculations and BACKSTEP launch operations. She is a Conclave Zendai.

Toff Garnet handles the engineering, systems repair, and improvements of the BACKSTEP program. He can also perform coordinate calculations and launch operations. He is a USC engineer who "died" in the line of duty. His wife, Rose, is a Sabra Courtesan, and they never desire to leave the BACKSTEP facilities. He knows and doesn't care if she's a courtesan.

Nicholas Forrest is the only living chrononaut. He is a Daear jaunter with a high pain threshold and possesses photographic memory. His jaunt range is currently unknown.

### ENIGMA
Chrononauts are sent into the past with highly secure information about the mission with all the intelligence they gathered up to the moment of the BACKSTEP. Sometimes this information is complete, sometimes there is very little information, and rarely there is none. The chrononaut also possesses an unforgeable programmable matter deposit in the form of a tattoo as well as a hidden memory area only very powerful telepaths can access so their identity can be confirmed. 

Once a BACKSTEP is performed the chrononaut makes contact using the keyword ENIGMA to alert personnel that a mission is active. Once their identity is confirmed, Tzimisce hands command over to the chrononaut and their word on the mission is final.

### TEMPORAL CENSORSHIP
A chrononaut that performs a BACKSTEP is temporally censored for a period of 5 days, starting from the moment they arrive in the past until they reach the same point in time that they initiated the BACKSTEP.

Temporal censorship prevents any technology  or psionic powers from seeing the chrononaut or their events during the entire temporal censorship period. 

### TEMPORAL DECOHERENCE
A chrononaut that performs a BACKSTEP suffers from termporal decoherence for a period of 5 days, starting from the moment they arrive in the past until they reach the same point in time they initiated the BACKSTEP.

Temporal decoherence
Travelling into the past causes minor things to change, so it is impossible to guarantee you can benefit in the past with knowledge of the future. This applies primarily to unplanned events like sports and games of chance. Deliberate actions with large scale consequences generally remain the same, but it is possible they happen sooner or later than the original event.

Having said that, some events appear impossible to prevent or alter. If you try to interrupt someone before they make a great scientific discovery, whatever sparked that moment of realization will still happen but in a different way. This is true for many things the stability of the future depends upon, like the discovery of the transistor or fusion reactors.

### TEMPORAL SIGNIFICANCE
Every thing and event in a timeline has a temporal signature that determines how much the future relies on that thing or event. This signature can only be detected by devices or beings from different times.

Temporal significance is measured in ratings between 0-1000.

### 5 DAYS
Due to the limits of available fuel and size of the reactor, backsteps are limited to 5 days.

### PILOT
The chrononaut and their past self will merge upon arrival to the past, causing the past self to "disappear" leaving only chrononaut. There can't be two instances of a chrononaut. This is one way to identify a backstep has occurred. The health of the chrononaut can be based entirely on the future version, entirely on the past version, or somewhere in between. So far it has been impossible to determine. Since the chrononaut is usually injured during the BACKSTEP it can be significant if both the past and future versions are injured.

### DODECAHEDRON
The dodecahedron merges with it's past self and becomes one in the same manner as a chrononaut. There can't be two instances of the dodecahedron.

### FUEL
There is limited fuel for the backstep dodecahedron with no known why to get or make more, so the use of a backstep must be for critical purposes only.

Recently an additional fuel source was discovered which might increase the number of days the dodecahedron can go back in time.

High powered Inanimate Matter Manipulators can produce this fuel, but no one has thought of this before because no one has been powerful enough to try.

### TEMPORAL MORTALITY
While on a mission the chrononaut is outside of the normal timestream until they return to their normal timestream. So if a chrononaut travels back 5 days, he will be outside of the normal timestream until he returns to the time when he made the BACKSTEP. During this time if the chrononaut dies he is dead. a different chrononaut can't go back and save him or stop him from going on the mission to prevent his death. No matter what happens, he will die at exactly the same date and time. Once he reenters the timestream at his departure point, he can be affected like everyone else including being saved from death by another chrononaut.
