# USC TACTICAL INTELLIGENCE UPDATES

## CODE NAME JUGGERNAUT IR
The Juggernaut has sterilzed 107 star systems in Chigru space with 856 worlds.

It appears the Juggernaut factories (code named Spawners) are producing units capable of radiating outwards from the Juggernauts initial line of conquest and capable of sterilizing additional systems. Estimates place the conquest of new systems will double every 2.94 standard USC days with the total sterilization of Chigru space within less than 17.82 standard USC weeks. At the present rate of expansion, it is estimated the Juggernaut will sterilize the quadrant within 37.61 standard USC weeks and the galaxy within 1.27 standard USC years.

The USC qualifies this as an Extinction Level Event (E.L.E.). E.L.E. protocols are being brought into place.
