# USC TACTICAL INTELLIGENCE UPDATES

## CODE NAME JUGGERNAUT
The Juggernaut has sterilzed 107 star systems in Chigru space with 856 worlds.

It appears the Juggernaut factories (code named Spawners) are producing units capable of radiating outwards from the Juggernauts initial line of conquest. Estimates place the conquest of new systems will double every 16.9 standard USC hours with the total sterilization of Chigru space within less than 14.82 standard USC weeks.
