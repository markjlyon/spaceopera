# BABABRAHAM'S REVELATIONS

Bababraham reveals he is really Drago Ivani, but even Drago Ivani is another identity. He also reveals the following information.

- He was once a part of an organization called The Patent Office.
- The Patent Office is really only interested in preserving original intellectual property of this universe.
- The technology used by the host of Corina's abductors must also have once been part of The Patent Office due to his tech.
- The Highguard Empire is using The Patent Office level technology.
- None of the Highguard Empire's tech will be anything but universe local, but it will exceed the technology level of the USC and governments of similar power.
- The Patent Office will not make a presence in the USC because it uses extra-universal (forbidden) tech.
- Bababraham created the Zendai to naturally breed psionics out of humanity, since psionics is from another universe.
- The Patent Office will allow individuals to submit intellectual property, independent of any organizational entity, so they can earn their own value to be used on licenses.
- He trusts Shara, likes Kiari and Tarna, but calls Shara's people, known as Xiilii, hypocrites and wants nothing to do with them. He warns the USC not to trust the Xiilii.
- He believes the SoulDra are most likely a slave race forced to capture or convert psionics from this universe.
- The rise of the Highguard Empire's technology and aggression means someone is most likely attempting another conquest of this galaxy, this time by trying to amass fleets from another quadrant with more advanced technology.
- The Fall of the Zendai Empire and the SoulDra invasion were probably an attempt at galactic conquest. He believes the displacement device thwarted this invasion.
- He provides the USC with information about The Patent Office, how to apply for patents, and how to use any value they earn to purchase their own licenses.
- He agrees to provide access to some of his own personal licenses as the need arises.
