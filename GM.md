# GM NOTES

## ADVANCES AND IMPROVEMENTS

### ADVANCES
Every game Episode gives the players an Advance, including the midseason and season finale Episodes.
These can be spent to improve Contacts, Languages, and Talents.
Talent levels can require multiple Advances to improve, so keep a record of how many Advances are being put aside for Talent levels.

Apply the Advance to a Contact die type improvement (invidivual = 1, group = 2, organization = 3).

Apply the Advance to a Spoken Language die type.

Apply the Advance to a Written Language die type.

Apply the Advance to a Talent (see below).

### IMPROVEMENTS
Improvements occur twice a season, once at the midway point and once in the season finale.
An Improvement does two things

## CHARACTER RESET UPCOMING
In another week we will be doing the character rebuild based on the new rules.
The Attributes, other than SOC and PSI will be lowered across the board.

## PERKS REWORK
The Perks are going to be worked into things that don't affect successes or failures, as those will be covered under Talents.
They will represent things like Eidtic Memory, Gorgeous, and Quick.
If you want something that affects a Check, use a Talent instead.

## TALENTS
Talents are a build your own bonus system.
You decide what Checks benefit, Attribute or Branch, and how they are affected.

Talents have two components, Roll and Keep, and although they are purchased separately they are considered part of a single Talent.
You could have the DEX Talent, with separate Roll and Keep levels, but it is still just the DEX Talent.

You may have as many Talents as you pay for.

Talents are written as <Attribute/Branch> Talent Auto X Roll Y Keep Z where X is the number of autosuccesses, Y the number of extra dice you roll, and Z the number of extra dice you get to keep.

Examples:
DEX Talent Auto 0 Roll 2 Keep 2.
Diplomacy Talent Auto 1 Roll 3 Keep 4.

### TALENT LEVEL COST
Each Talent level costs 1 Advance per level.
If you pick up a new Talent the cost is 1.
If you increase the level of an existing Talent, the cost is new level of the Talent.
So to raise a Talent from 2 to 3 costs 3 Advances.

### TALENT ATTRIBUTE OR BRANCH
When picking a new Talent you pick an Attribute or Branch.
All Checks made with that Attribute or Branch benefit from your new Talent.

### TALENT TYPE
When picking a Talent you must decide if the Talent adds its level to the total number of dice you Roll or the total number of dice you Keep.

Talents that affect the same Attribute or Branch can be used together, so if you had a DEX Talent with Roll 2 and Keep 2 and Security Talent with Roll 1 and Keep 1 you would Roll 3 and Keep 3 when firing an energy pistol in addition to what you normally roll and keep.

### TALENT LEVELS
Talents levels can go as high as you keep paying for them to go.
Once a Talent has both a Roll 4 and Keep 4, you may convert those Talent levels into an autosuccess for 4 Advances.

You could have the DEX Talent with Roll 6 and Keep 4 and choose to use 4 Advances to convert it to a DEX Talent with Auto 1 and Roll 2 (Roll 6 - 4 and Keep 4 - 4).
