# The Disappearance (505) of Corina Bathe

Massive Dynamic interrupts Emesyn during a casual gathering of friends at the exclusive Shangri-La club.

All flexies nearby give audible and visual alerts. 

Massive Dynamic repeats the following message until Emesyn responds,"Incoming 505 alert. Possible 261 and 214 in progress."

Once Emesyn contacts Massive Dynamic all flexi alerts end, all dance lights and music stop, and the room becomes devoid of all visual and audio distractions.

Massive Dynamic's voice proceeds.

"Mrs. Sabra, you asked me to keep an eye on Grimaldi personnel, protect them, and notify you of any threats or incidents. I am notifying you as requested."

"What is the incident?", asks Emesyn.

"I continuously monitor all personnel locations and medical status. All times discussed are USC standard times."

"17 seconds ago Ms. Bathe's lifesigns showed severe distress and trauma, then her signals were terminated. 1:49 seconds ago Ms. Bathe entered a signal dead zone. All methods I use to track personnel, including electronic, chemical, and radioactive trackers, have proven ineffective. I have been unable to reacquire her using local visual, audio, electromagnetic, and orbital sensors. This would indicate familiarity with both our primary and secondary intelligence capabilities."

"Local police, security forces, mercenaries, and the Grimaldi Emergency Team for Medical Extractions (GET ME) in Raptor 02, consisting of civilian and military personnel, were dispatched within 6 seconds of her signal being lost."

"She is the 29th woman of a very similar appearance, a tall voluptuous blonde, to go missing in this region in the last 18 months. I conclude it is the same offender or offenders. The remains of previous victims were discovered between 3:11:34 and 5:27:16 after their disappearance."

"It has now been 1:02 seconds. Ms. Bathe has at least 3:10:32 and at most 5:26:14 before her remains are discovered. According to my analysis, travel and preparation times needed by the perpetrator to terminate Ms. Bathe and dispose of her remains would indicate an expected time of death between 1:49:54 and 2:56:19 from now."

"Local crime prevention and investigation organizational data for this event is... unhelpful."

"Raptor 02 has arrived at the scene of her disappearance and are investigating. Local authorities have been informed."

"Based on your past behavior I have the Morrigan ready to beam you up at your discretion. Coordinates have already been sent to Cmdr Zimmerman."
