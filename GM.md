# GM NOTES

## CHARACTER RESET UPCOMING
In another week we will be doing the character rebuild based on the new rules.
The Attributes, other than SOC and PSI will be lowered across the board.

## PERKS REWORK
The Perks are going to be worked into things that don't affect successes or failures, as those will be covered under Talents.

## TALENTS
Talents are a build your own bonus system.
You decide what Checks benefit and how they are affected.

### TALENT LEVEL COST
Each Talent level costs 1 Advance per level.
You can pick up a new Talent or increase the level of an existing talent.

If you pick up a new Talent the cost is 1.
If you increase the level of a Talent, the cost is new level of the Talent.
So to raise a Talent from 2 to 3 costs 3 Advances.

### TALENT ATTRIBUTE OR BRANCH
When picking a new Talent you pick an Attribute or Branch.
All Checks made with that Attribute or Branch benefit from your new Talent.

### TALENT TYPE
When picking a Talent you must decide if the Talent adds its level to the total number of dice you Roll or the total number of dice you Keep.
