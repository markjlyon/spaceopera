# GAME GLOSSARY

## antimatter
Antimatter is negatively charged hydrogen atoms used as fuel for APRs, impulse engines, most FTL engines, and explosive weapons.

It is highly volatile, releasing 100% of its energy by mass, when it comes into contact with positively charged matter.

It is stored primarily in antimatter storage tanks using intense magnetic or warp fields. Alternatively it can be stored in muon lattices which contain only neutral  charges.

Antimatter can be transported using a transporter.

## antimatter breeder reactor
Antimatter breeder reactors convert matter and energy in to negatively charged hydrogen atoms and store them in antimatter tanks or muon lattices for transport.

## antimatter storage tank
Antimatter storage tanks use intense magnetic fields or muon lattices to contain antimatter for transport.

Antimatter storage tanks can be transported using a transporter.

## auxiliary power reactors
Auxillary power reactors (APR) is an antimatter reactor designed to supply continuos power for systems whose power requirements rarely change, such as buildings, bases, and life support systems.

APRs on bases and farships are a secondary power source designed to power redundant, lowered powered systems such as life support, gravity plating, and onboard communications.

Antimatter is generated using antimatter breeder reactor technology.

## protomatter
Protomatter is variably charged muon atoms used as fuel for APRs, impulse engines, jump drives, hyperspace drives, hyperspace fold generators, and extremely devastating weapons.

It is extremely unstable, releasing 100% of its energy by mass, when it comes into contact with matter and also alters the subatomic and atomic structure matter in its blast radius.

Protomatter is considered too dangerous for regular use and has been replaced by antimatter since the invention of antimatter breeder reactors.

Protomatter is generated using protomatter breeder reactor technology or replicators.

Protomatter can be transported using a transporter.
