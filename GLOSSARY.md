# GAME GLOSSARY

## antimatter
Antimatter is negatively charged hydrogen atoms used as fuel for APRs, impulse engines, most FTL engines, and explosive weapons.

It is highly volatile, releasing 100% of its energy by mass, when it comes into contact with positively charged matter.

It is stored primarily in antimatter storage tanks using intense magnetic or warp fields. Alternatively it can be stored in muon lattices which contain only neutral charges.

Antimatter can be transported using a transporter.

Antimatter is generated using antimatter breeder reactor technology.

## antimatter breeder reactor
Antimatter breeder reactors convert matter and energy in to negatively charged hydrogen atoms and store them in antimatter tanks or muon lattices for transport.

## antimatter storage tank
Antimatter storage tanks use intense magnetic fields or muon lattices to contain antimatter for transport.

Antimatter storage tanks can be transported using a transporter.

## antiprotons
Antiprotons are negatively charged protons used as fuel for slipstream and quantum slipstream engines, and can be used as crude explosives equivalent to nuclear weapons of similar mass.

They are not as volatile as antimatter or protomatter as they only convert 21.67% of their mass into energy, with a resulting 14.37% of their mass being converted into pions. Any remaining mass is lost to light and heat.

Antiprotons are generated using antiproton breeder reactor technology.

## antiproton storage tank
Antiproton storage tanks use intense magnetic fields or holo matrices to contain antimatter for transport.

## antiproton breeder reactor
Antiproton breeder reactors convert photons and pions into antiprotons and stores them in antiproton storage cells.

## auxiliary power reactors
Auxillary power reactor (APR) is an antimatter reactor designed to supply continuous power for systems whose power requirements rarely change, such as buildings, bases, and life support systems.

APRs on bases and farships are a secondary power source designed to power redundant, lowered powered systems such as life support, gravity plating, and onboard communications.

## latinum
Latinum is the only known material in the known universe that is completely chemically and electromagnetically inert, has no isotopes, can't be transported or replicated, and has no known method of manufacture.

This makes it ideal as an unforgeable currency and is used by most governments for this purpose.

## lightfold drive

## flatspace (hyperspace)
Flatspace technology allows a region of four dimensional pocket of spacetime to be accessed using a two dimensional portal "container". This portal "container" is always a physical object which surrounds or holds the flatspace area and can be damaged or destroyed, like a suitcase or picture frame. Destroying the flatspace container has the same effect as placing one flatspace inside another. 

Flatspace can be used for safe rooms, storage and cargo areas, research facilities, medical status devices, power generators, ammo packs, and in some cases defensive barriers. Cost and imagination are the only real limiters.

Flatspaces cannot contain other flatspaces. Inserting flatspaces within other flatspaces destroys the flatspaces and randomly ejects some of the materials in those flatspaces. Non ejected materials are lost in hyperspace.

## pions
Pions are are the waste byproduct of antiproton slipstream and quantum slipstream engines. They can be recondensed back into antiprotons through an antiproton breeder reactor using photons.

Pions are extremely volatile and convert 100% of their mass into energy, but their nature makes them difficult to use as a weapon as they are instantly converted into antiprotons upon their interaction with photons.

## pion spillover

Pion spillover occurs when a pion tank exceeds its capacity and releases its pions, which then interact with photons converting them into antiprotons, causing massive destruction.

Such an event is caused by critical damage to the pion tanks or sabotage.

## pion tank
Pion tanks capture and hold pions released by the antiproton reactions of slipstream and quantum slipstream drives for later use. These pions are used in antiproton breeder reactors.

## programmable matter

## protomatter
Protomatter is variably charged muon atoms used as fuel for APRs, impulse engines, jump drives, hyperspace drives, hyperspace fold generators, and extremely devastating weapons.

It is extremely unstable, releasing 100% of its energy by mass, when it comes into contact with matter and also alters the subatomic and atomic structure matter in its blast radius. In some experiments this subatomic and atomic alteration has been partially controlled, such as in the creation of huge amounts of titanium, uranimum, or thorium. Unfortunately, most of the altered matter is unstable quickly decaying into lead and other extremely stable atoms.

Protomatter is considered too dangerous for regular use and has been replaced by antimatter since the invention of antimatter breeder reactors.

Protomatter is generated using protomatter breeder reactor technology or replicators, making it extremely dangerous.

Protomatter can be transported using a transporter.
