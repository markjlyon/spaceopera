# GAME GLOSSARY

## antimatter
Antimatter is negatively charged hydrogen atoms used as fuel for APRs, impulse engines, most FTL engines, and explosive weapons.

It is highly volatile, releasing 100% of its energy by mass, when it comes into contact with positively charged matter.

It is stored primarily in antimatter storage tanks using intense magnetic or warp fields. Alternatively it can be stored in muon lattices which contain only neutral charges.

Antimatter can be transported using a transporter.

Antimatter is generated using antimatter breeder reactor technology.

## antimatter breeder reactor
Antimatter breeder reactors convert matter and energy in to negatively charged hydrogen atoms and store them in antimatter tanks or muon lattices for transport.

## antimatter storage tank
Antimatter storage tanks use intense magnetic fields or muon lattices to contain antimatter for transport.

Antimatter storage tanks can be transported using a transporter.

## antiprotons
Antiprotons are negatively charged protons used as fuel for slipstream and quantum slipstream engines, and can be used as crude explosives equivalent to nuclear weapons of similar mass.

They are not as volatile as antimatter or protomatter as they only convert 21.67% of their mass into energy, with a resulting 14.37% of their mass being converted into pions. Any remaining mass is lost to light and heat.

Antiprotons are generated using antiproton breeder reactor technology.

## antiproton storage tank
Antiproton storage tanks use intense magnetic fields or holo matrices to contain antimatter for transport.

## antiproton breeder reactor
Antiproton breeder reactors convert photons and pions into antiprotons and stores them in antiproton storage cells.

## auxiliary power reactors
Auxillary power reactor (APR) is an antimatter reactor designed to supply continuous power for systems whose power requirements rarely change, such as buildings, bases, and life support systems.

APRs on bases and farships are a secondary power source designed to power redundant, lowered powered systems such as life support, gravity plating, and onboard communications.

## fargate (hyperspace fold generator)
A fargate is two hyperspace fold generators operating in sync to create a shortest path hyperspace bridge between two points along a hyperspace pathway. A functional fargate can operate continuously with no need for downtime.

Objects moving into a fargate always enter the "top spin" opening of the fargate while objects exiting a fargate always exit the "bottom spin" opening of the fargate. It is not possible for matter to enter the "bottom spin" opening of a fargate and it is not possible for matter to exit the "top spin" opening of a fargate.

There is no known limit to the distance between two synced fargates and they were used to cross galaxies for thousands of years, before The Fall.

Syncing two fargates is a monumentally complex task that generally takes months or years of calculations and calibration.

## force field
Force fields are intensely powerful electromagnetic fields that disrupt energy and matter upon impact as a form of "energy armor". If the amount of energy used against a force field exceeds its rating, it will collapse and require several minutes to clear the heat and ionization of collapse before it can be activated again.

Force fields are generally used for temporary structures, such as sealing blown bulkheads, containment fields, and even structural integrity fields. They rarely see service as defensive technologies as shields are considered superior.  

## hardlight (hard holographs)
Hardlight constructs are objects made of suspended photons, force fields, and projected energy fields in rooms specifically built to house all the necessary equipment. Used primarily in holosuites for entertainment purposes to create holograms that are as real as possible to the senses, their quality ranges from clearly fake holographic objects to people so real you would swear they are just another holosuite guest.

At the extreme limits of technology hardlight can be used to make weapons and armor.   

## hyperspace drive
Hyperdrives are the second type of FTL drives created by humans. They are nuclear powered and can move a ship between two known hyperspace destinations. Hyperspace travel requires incredibly complex calculations that can only be performed by expert, AI, or AS systems. The greater the distance travelled and the heavier the traffic the longer the calculations take.

Hyperdrives take only a fraction of the travel time required by jump drives, but travel time is based on the complexity of the trip and can range from two hours to just over three days.

## hyperspace fold generator

## jump drive
Jump drives are the first FTL drives ever created by humans. They are nuclear powered and can jump anywhere between 0.00001 and 6 times the jump drive's focus rating in light years (usually 6 to 36 light years).

Jump drive travel always takes ~137 standard USC hours. Ships in a jump can't detect other objects but also can't be detected. If a ship exits its jump before reaching its destination it exits the jump as a lump of wreckage and plasma. No one has ever survived such a tragedy.

Jumps take about five standard USC minutes to plot and the jump drive takes about three standard USC minutes to spin up for a jump. It is possible to purchase pre-calcuated jumps for two very specific points in space, but they become outdated as the stars steadily move through space.

Jump drive ships generally only carry enough fuel for two jumps.

## jump gate
Jump gates work like jump drives except the travelling ship does not need to possess its own jump drive or other FTL technology. This is used for short distance world to world travel with extremely well known origins and destinations. Travel time is still ~137 standard USC hours, but the odds of a failed jump are virtually 0%.

## latinum
Latinum is the only known material in the known universe that is completely chemically and electromagnetically inert, has no isotopes, can't be transported or replicated, and has no known method of manufacture.

This makes it ideal as an unforgeable currency and is used by most governments for this purpose.

## lightfold drive

## flatspace (hyperspace)
Flatspace technology allows a region of four dimensional pocket of spacetime to be accessed using a two dimensional portal "container". This portal "container" is always a physical object which surrounds or holds the flatspace area and can be damaged or destroyed, like a suitcase or picture frame. Destroying the flatspace container has the same effect as placing one flatspace inside another. 

Flatspace can be used for safe rooms, storage and cargo areas, research facilities, medical status devices, power generators, ammo packs, and in some cases defensive barriers. Cost and imagination are the only real limiters.

Flatspaces cannot contain other flatspaces. Inserting flatspaces within other flatspaces destroys the flatspaces and randomly ejects some of the materials in those flatspaces. Non ejected materials are lost in hyperspace.

## pions
Pions are are the waste byproduct of antiproton slipstream and quantum slipstream engines. They can be recondensed back into antiprotons through an antiproton breeder reactor using photons.

Pions are extremely volatile and convert 100% of their mass into energy, but their nature makes them difficult to use as a weapon as they are instantly converted into antiprotons upon their interaction with photons.

## pion spillover

Pion spillover occurs when a pion tank exceeds its capacity and releases its pions, which then interact with photons converting them into antiprotons, causing massive destruction.

Such an event is caused by critical damage to the pion tanks or sabotage.

## pion tank
Pion tanks capture and hold pions released by the antiproton reactions of slipstream and quantum slipstream drives for later use. These pions are used in antiproton breeder reactors.

## prestescene

## programmable matter

## protomatter
Protomatter is variably charged muon atoms used as fuel for APRs, impulse engines, jump drives, hyperspace drives, hyperspace fold generators, and extremely devastating weapons.

It is extremely unstable, releasing 100% of its energy by mass, when it comes into contact with matter and also alters the subatomic and atomic structure of matter in its blast radius. In some experiments this subatomic and atomic alteration has been partially controlled, such as in the creation of huge amounts of titanium, uranimum, or thorium. Unfortunately, most of the altered matter is unstable quickly decaying into lead and other extremely stable atoms.

Protomatter is considered too dangerous for regular use and has been replaced by antimatter since the invention of antimatter breeder reactors.

Protomatter is generated using protomatter breeder reactor technology or replicators, making it extremely dangerous.

Protomatter can be transported using a transporter.

## wormhole (stringtech)
Wormhole (stringtech) connects two mapped locations in space together, allowing instantaneous transmission of energy and matter between these two points. The wormhole only requires an active wormhole generator at either the origin or the destination.

Wormholes can only operate for a maximum of 34 standard USC minutes before that area of space is so disrupted by the wormhole's tidal gravitational forces that local spacetime becomes too unstable to allow a wormhole for 34 minutes.

Wormhole event horizons are easily detected and leave an "echo" that can be detected for several hours, so wormholes are obvious during and after their use.
