## GOLD PRESSED LATINUM

The USC and many other highly advanced governments use the physical material known as Latinum (£) as currency.
The advantage of Latinum is that is it not a fiat currency, it's value is based on how much of it exists.
Latinum's main advantage over other currencies is that it can't be manufactured, replicated, or moved by a transporter.
It represents the highest value currency in the galaxy due to the difficulty in stealing it and the impossibility of forging it.

## ZENDAI CREDITS

All Zendai governments use a form of currency known as Credits (€). 
Each Zendai government has a unique name for their currency (Drago-Kadzai uses Crowns, Fenrir uses Marks, Sabra uses Hearts) and although exchanges fluctuate, they tend to keep a standard value with other currencies. So the Fenrir Mark was usually worth an average of 1.2 Hearts or 1.8 Crowns.

Each Credit is used in partial amounts and possesses 5 decimal places.
Most goods and services cost only partial Credits.
A drink might cost between 0.0050€ and 0.00250€ while a new repulsorlift vehicle could cost 1.00000€ to 1.50000€.

1€ is worth approximately 1£ Strip or ₦10000.

## KZINTI NIN

The Kzinti government uses a form of currency known as Nin (₦).
It is based on the honor of who one has done business with so purchase prices differ based on who is the buyer and the seller.

₦100 is worth approximiately 0.01000€ or 1£ Slip.
