## ZENDAI CREDITS

All Zendai governments use a form of Credits, that while having different names (Hearts, Crowns, etc.), are all similarly based.

1 Credit is subdivided into 5 decimal places like 1.00000. Most goods and services cost only partial credits. A drink might cost 1.00100 while a new repulsorlift vehicle would cost 1.00000 to 1.50000 Credits.
