# HIGH TECHNOLOGY RULES

## TECHNOLOGY TYPES

### BIOTECH
Derived from biology, biotech relates to living creatures and the systems that bind them together.

Biotech is unique in that it's the only the technology that fully passes on to your descendents.
While certain items might require implantation (e.g. a pathogenesis organ), the vast majority of Biotech is written into your character's DNA before birth.
High-Biotech civilizations know effective ways to make major changes after conception.

### COGNITECH
The study of cognitive science has given birth to cognitech: techniques and devices that influence one’s own mind.

Meshes and Foci become available at Biotech 5.

### METATECH
Social science is a hard science in this day and age, as strongly grounded in mathematics as astronomy or biology.
Its techniques, devices, and methods are referred to as Metatechnology.

Metatech represents charisma, charm, savvy, force of will, and perfect inflection.

### NANOTECH
Nanotechnology is the application of physics, engineering, and chemistry to objects built on extremely small scales: a few billionths of a meter.

Nanotech allows for very detailed examination of an object or area — down to the microscopic level at Nanotech 5, or the molecular level at Nanotech 7. 
However, such examination is not fast, nor is it automatic.
Scrutinizing a crime scene ten feet across can take hours at the microscopic level, and days or even weeks at the molecular level.
Once you find what you’re looking for (say, a skin flake that might be from the criminal), there’s some more waiting to do before you can complete the DNA scan.

### STRINGTECH
Based on string theory (a contender for the "ultimate theory" of physics), stringtech applies physical forces to the world with varying degrees of power and sophistication.

Some regions prohibit high Stringtech ratings for legal and safety reasons, the assumption being that someone who built a powerful weapon into
themselves didn't do it just for home defense.
This is usually a fair assumption.
For this reason, characters may "peace bond" their Stringtech, making it difficult to restart (takes one minute), and other characters with level 5 or better Nanotech will be able to verify this.
Patent officers often have legal status, and thus generally have the equivalent of a concealed weapons license in most civilizations, so this usually isn't necessary.

| TECH LEVEL | DAMAGE DESCRIPTION |
| ---------- | ----------- |
|  1 | Fists, kicks, brass knuckles. All countermeasures<br/>have the Energy-Transparent descriptor at this stage. |
|  2 | Knives, two-by-fours, carpentry hammers. |
|  3 | Trained martial artists, small handguns, sharp weapons<br/>with leverage (e.g. swords, axes). |
|  4 | Rifles, large handguns, tasers, mild explosives<br/>(e.g. grenades), 20th century riot gear. |
|  5 | Tank guns, high explosives, high-power lasers, railguns,<br/>nanoweave greatcoats. Near-c and Energy descriptors available.<br/>Countermeasures stop having the Energy-Transparent descriptor. |
|  6 | Conventional bombs, hydrofluoric acid, compression beams,<br/> tank armor. |
|  7 | Dissociation beams, type I nanophages. Supersymmetric<br/> descriptor available. |
|  8 | Lightning strikes, the surface of the sun, fuelair<br/> explosions, decay-induction fields. |
|  9 | Inversion beams, nuclear blasts, type II nanophages |
| 10 | Core of the sun, fission-fusion beam, vortex sinks |
