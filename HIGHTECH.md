# HIGH TECHNOLOGY RULES

## TECHNOLOGY TYPES

### BIOTECH
Derived from biology, biotech relates to living creatures and the systems that bind them together.

Biotech is unique in that it's the only the technology that fully passes on to your descendents.
While certain items might require implantation (e.g. a pathogenesis organ), the vast majority of Biotech is written into your character's DNA before birth.
High-Biotech civilizations know effective ways to make major changes after conception.

### COGNITECH
The study of cognitive science has given birth to cognitech: techniques and devices that influence one’s own mind.

Meshes and Foci become available at Biotech 5.

### METATECH
Social science is a hard science in this day and age, as strongly grounded in mathematics as astronomy or biology.
Its techniques, devices, and methods are referred to as Metatechnology.

Metatech represents charisma, charm, savvy, force of will, and perfect inflection.

### NANOTECH
Nanotechnology is the application of physics, engineering, and chemistry to objects built on extremely small scales: a few billionths of a meter.

Nanotech allows for very detailed examination of an object or area — down to the microscopic level at Nanotech 5, or the molecular level at Nanotech 7. 
However, such examination is not fast, nor is it automatic.
Scrutinizing a crime scene ten feet across can take hours at the microscopic level, and days or even weeks at the molecular level.
Once you find what you’re looking for (say, a skin flake that might be from the criminal), there’s some more waiting to do before you can complete the DNA scan.

### STRINGTECH
Based on string theory (a contender for the "ultimate theory" of physics), stringtech applies physical forces to the world with varying degrees of power and sophistication.

Some regions prohibit high Stringtech ratings for legal and safety reasons, the assumption being that someone who built a powerful weapon into
themselves didn't do it just for home defense.
This is usually a fair assumption.
For this reason, characters may "peace bond" their Stringtech, making it difficult to restart (takes one minute), and other characters with level 5 or better Nanotech will be able to verify this.
Patent officers often have legal status, and thus generally have the equivalent of a concealed weapons license in most civilizations, so this usually isn't necessary.

## PROFESSIONS
Professions represent Branchs and Tours for non-USC Military personnel. USC Military branches not only provide cross-training among other branches, they also cross Technology Types and provide much better coverage than civilian training or experience.

It takes time to learn a Profession.
Characters add up the time required for each level of each Profession to determine their starting age.

| Level | Total Years |
| ----- | ----------- |
|  1 |   1 |
|  2 |   4 |
|  3 |  10 |
|  4 |  20 |
|  5 |  35 |
|  6 |  56 |
|  7 |  84 |
|  8 | 120 |
|  9 | 165 |
| 10 | 220 |

### Agriculture {Cognitech}
This Profession covers everything you need to live off the land: when to plant and harvest, how to interpret (or make) weather predictions, how to sell your crops to the public or a distributor, how to handle livestock, irrigation and hydroponics techniques, and a basic understanding of genetic engineering.

All tasks for this Profession are considered specialized, except for basic planting and harvesting.

### Artist (two specific arts) {Metatech}
Artist concentrations include playing an instrument, novel writing, sculpture, singing, dancing, painting, infosphere design, and any other sort of aesthetic endeavour.
Since most artists have more than a single talent, those who pick the Artist Profession can choose two specialties, such as singing and playing the guitar.

Good artists will also know how best to arrange and sell their wares, incorporate memetic techniques, critique the works of others, and have good networking skills.

All tasks for this Profession are considered highly specialized. 
Someone without any levels in this Profession is stuck drawing stick figures.

### Athlete (specific sport) {Biotech}
Good athletes can not only play their sport of choice, they can promote themselves, work up crowds, and analyze other teams' strategies.

There are two specialized tasks for Athletes: coaching, and recalling obscure or rarely-used rules such as baseball’s infield fly rule.

### Courtesan {Metatech}
Courtesan is rarely a character's only Profession.
It's the art of attracting people of your preferred gender(s), having a good time out on the town with them, and perhaps taking them home for some snuggling.
Many people pick up a Tour or two of Courtesan, but only prostitutes and "escorts" do it for a living.

Specialized tasks for Courtesans are adult in nature.

### Criminal {Metatech}
Criminals know how to break the incredibly effective security measures found in the lower-technology civilizations, and how to run numbers or confidence scams that circumvent them in the high-tech civilizations.
They know other criminals, can critique law enforcement and security methods, and can sneak around to evade capture.

Almost all Criminal tasks are specialized.
Running a simple scam like three-card monte is not, but such things are unlikely to fool anyone in this age.

**Special Note**: This Profession is only available at character creation to those who belong to an organized crime group or society.
Others must purchase it during the game, through trial and error (imprisonment).

### Crisis Control {Nanotech}
Crisis Control includes firefighting, riot control, paramedic, and nanophage response training, as well as the ability to remain calm under fire and react quickly to danger. Crisis Control specialists are essential in any city, and can easily find work.

Responding to any sort of life-threatening event is a specialized task. In other words, if you really need Crisis Control, you’d better have it.

### Engineer (specific tech) {Cognitech}
Concentrations for this Profession are the five major technologies: Biotech, Cognitech, Metatech, Nanotech, and Stringtech.

Engineers do practical things with their technology of choice.
All engineers can create and critique the designs for devices or procedures that fall under their concentration.
Biotech engineers make living organisms or apply them to a given problem.
Cognitech engineers make Meshes and Foci.
Metatech engineers are active psychohistorians or culture designers.
Nanotech engineers work with construction, from bridges to nanophages.
Stringtech engineers make weapons, power plants, and starships.

All tasks for this Profession are considered specialized.

### Explorer {Cognitech}
You have some expertise in dealing with new planets. You can determine whether the world’s conditions, flora, and fauna are dangerous to human life.
You have a good eye for placing settlements, are experienced with global positioning systems, and know basic surveying and orienteering techniques.
You can do most of this without an infosphere in place, and suffer no low-tech penalties for operating without one.
You still take such penalties if you are bereft of your other tools.

Orienteering (finding your way in a wilderness without an infosphere) can be performed untrained.
All other tasks are specialized.

### Financial {Cognitech}
You can buy and sell goods, to the public or to distributors.
You can make reliable predictions of the stock markets, use and resist memetic sales techniques, create complex business plans, and ensure that your own company is properly run.
You have a good head for administration.

Only market prediction and business planning are specialized tasks.

### Legal {Cognitech}
Despite the fresh start the Diaspora gave, many civilizations' legal systems are exceptionally complicated.
You have every law and its interpretation at your fingertips, and can accurately guess whether new actions would be considered legal.
You can also argue your case in court, or draft new laws for a specific effect.

In civilizations with infospheres, only courtroom argumentation (if it still exists) is a specialized task.
In other locales, nearly the entire profession is considered specialized.
Most Old-Worlder settlements do not have this Profession.

### Locality (specific civilization) {Metatech}
You must concentrate in a particular Civilization when choosing this Profession.
This Profession represents familiarity with a civilization, its subcultures, languages, beliefs, geography, politics, well-known laws, and more.
You can understand natives of your chosen civilization without translation.

All USC memebers have Locality (USC) 5, all Sabra have Locality (Sabra) 5, etc.

All tasks for this Profession are considered specialized.
All characters receive this Profession for their home civilization at level 5.
Some characters will increase it as they grow older; others will be content with the areas and people they know.

### Media {Metatech}
Media specialists can put together advertising campaigns, do some minor writing and editing work, spread or squash rumors, hold press conferences, create effective memetic devices, and generally play the infosphere like an instrument.
This Profession also covers investigative reporting and some general information gathering.

Spreading credible rumors and creating memetic devices are specialized tasks.

### Medical {Cognitech}
Medical professionals range from nurses to surgeons to general practitioners to paramedics. 
Even specialists in cybernetics and symbiotics would use this Profession.
Medical research falls under the Researcher (Biotech) profession.

Any Medical task beyond stopping someone from bleeding or delivering CPR is considered specialized.

### Outdoorsman {Biotech}
To survive outdoors, with nothing but a tent and some rations, requires experience that most people in the modern age simply don’t have.
You can hike, swim, scale cliffs, spelunk, kayak, hunt your own food, and generally make your way across the wilderness.
With access to modern technology, any task from this Profession can be considered non-specialized.

Without it, consider any task more complex than hiking to be specialized.
As with most low-tech penalties, this does not apply to Old-Worlders.

### Police {Nanotech}
This Profession covers all aspects of law enforcement: investigation, surveillance, forensics, shaking down informants, keeping an angry crowd from rioting, subduing dangerous criminals, and more.
Some legal knowledge is included, especially in the areas of human rights and criminal rights.

All Police tasks are specialized, except for combat and some commonly-known legal matters.

### Political {Metatech}
Politicians know how to work a crowd, get legislation passed, lobby for changes in laws, cut through red tape (or snare others in it), recognize psychohistorical manipulation, and perhaps engage in some themselves.
They can behave properly in high society, negotiate treaties, and write legislation.

Most Political tasks are considered specialized, not necessarily because of a need for specific information or training, but because only an insider gets anything done.

### Programmer {Cognitech}
Programmers write and update the code that runs everything in the universe outside of the Old World.
They also know how to make programs easier to use, upload or present their programs for sale, and understand data encryption.

Most tasks in this Profession are specialized.
Those with Meshes are an exception; they can use their computer interface to create very simple programs with only a few logical steps.

### Religious {Metatech}
Religious figures know their doctrine, and often the doctrine of other religions as well.
They can communicate effectively to large groups, and know how to recruit new members.
They are familiar with memetic techniques and know how to recognize them.

The USC and surrounding human civilizations don't have any true religions as such, but humans are not alone in the galaxy.

The memetic aspects of this Profession, and deeper aspects of the religious doctrine, are considered specialized tasks.

### Researcher (specific tech) {Cognitech}
Concentrations for this Profession are the five major technologies: Biotech, Cognitech, Metatech, Nanotech, and Stringtech.

Researchers not only pull on existing information, they can create reasonable hypotheses and the experiments needed to test them.
They can also contact other researchers in their field and they can inspect others' theories for flaws.

Looking up existing information is not a specialized task; all other tasks are.

### Soldier {Stringtech}
Soldiers can not only shoot accurately and keep their head in battle, they have a working knowledge of tactics and strategy, can deploy countermeasures for the best effect, can recognize existing strategies and the flaws inherent in them, and can endure significant physical trauma.

Merely shooting a gun or being in a fight is not a specialized task. Keeping one’s cool or organizing a strategy are.

### Spacer {Nanotech}
Spacers can maneuver in zero-g, operate spaceships, and keep their cool during emergencies such as fire and oxygen leaks. 
Those with this Profession also have the know-how to use their other Professions in zero-gravity situations.
Those born on starships with little experience on planets do not need this Profession to operate in zero-g, but they still need it for other purposes.

All Spacer tasks are specialized.

### Spy {Metatech}
Spies can analyze and prepare reports, sneak around unnoticed, disguise themselves, conduct surveillance, and infiltrate closed organizations.

All elements of this Profession are considered specialized.

### Teacher {Metatech}
Teachers instruct others in the use of a particular Profession (or, occasionally, a Capability such as a Psionic power).
Modern teaching methods are relatively general, so one need not specialize within this Profession.

There are no specialized tasks for this Profession, though one should remember that teaching without this Profession causes a point of Stress each time and can be very draining.
