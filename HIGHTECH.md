# HIGH TECHNOLOGY RULES

## TECHNOLOGY TYPES

### BIOTECH
Derived from biology, biotech relates to living creatures and the systems that bind them together.

Biotech is unique in that it's the only the technology that fully passes on to your descendents.
While certain items might require implantation (e.g. a pathogenesis organ), the vast majority of Biotech is written into your character's DNA before birth.
High-Biotech civilizations know effective ways to make major changes after conception.

### COGNITECH
The study of cognitive science has given birth to cognitech: techniques and devices that influence one’s own mind.

Meshes and Foci become available at Biotech 5.

### METATECH
Social science is a hard science in this day and age, as strongly grounded in mathematics as astronomy or biology.
Its techniques, devices, and methods are referred to as Metatechnology.

Metatech represents charisma, charm, savvy, force of will, and perfect inflection.

### NANOTECH
Nanotechnology is the application of physics, engineering, and chemistry to objects built on extremely small scales: a few billionths of a meter.

Nanotech allows for very detailed examination of an object or area — down to the microscopic level at Nanotech 5, or the molecular level at Nanotech 7. 
However, such examination is not fast, nor is it automatic.
Scrutinizing a crime scene ten feet across can take hours at the microscopic level, and days or even weeks at the molecular level.
Once you find what you’re looking for (say, a skin flake that might be from the criminal), there’s some more waiting to do before you can complete the DNA scan.

### STRINGTECH
Based on string theory (a contender for the "ultimate theory" of physics), stringtech applies physical forces to the world with varying degrees of power and sophistication.

Some regions prohibit high Stringtech ratings for legal and safety reasons, the assumption being that someone who built a powerful weapon into
themselves didn't do it just for home defense.
This is usually a fair assumption.
For this reason, characters may "peace bond" their Stringtech, making it difficult to restart (takes one minute), and other characters with level 5 or better Nanotech will be able to verify this.
Patent officers often have legal status, and thus generally have the equivalent of a concealed weapons license in most civilizations, so this usually isn't necessary.

| TECH LEVEL | DAMAGE DESCRIPTION |
| ---------- | ----------- |
|  1 | Fists, kicks, brass knuckles. All countermeasures have the Energy-Transparent descriptor at this stage. |
|  2 | Knives, two-by-fours, carpentry hammers. |
|  3 | Trained martial artists, small handguns, sharp weapons with leverage (e.g. swords, axes). |
|  4 | Rifles, large handguns, tasers, mild explosives (e.g. grenades), 20th century riot gear. |
|  5 | Tank guns, high explosives, high-power lasers, railguns, nanoweave greatcoats. Near-c and Energy descriptors available. Countermeasures stop having the Energy-Transparent descriptor. |
|  6 | Conventional bombs, hydrofluoric acid, compression beams, tank armor. |
|  7 | Dissociation beams, type I nanophages. Supersymmetric descriptor available. |
|  8 | Lightning strikes, the surface of the sun, fuelair explosions, decay-induction fields. |
|  9 | Inversion beams, nuclear blasts, type II nanophages |
| 10 | Core of the sun, fission-fusion beam, vortex sinks |

## PROFESSIONS
Professions represent Branchs and Tours for non-USC Military personnel.

### Artist (two specific arts) {Metatech}
Artist concentrations include playing an instrument, novel writing, sculpture, singing, dancing, painting, infosphere design, and any other sort of aesthetic endeavour.
Since most artists have more than a single talent, those who pick the Artist Profession can choose two specialties, such as singing and playing the guitar.

Good artists will also know how best to arrange and sell their wares, incorporate memetic techniques, critique the works of others, and have good networking skills.

All tasks for this Profession are considered highly specialized. 
Someone without any levels in this Profession is stuck drawing stick figures.

### Athlete (specific sport) {Biotech}
Good athletes can not only play their sport of choice, they can promote themselves, work up crowds, and analyze other teams' strategies.

There are two specialized tasks for Athletes: coaching, and recalling obscure or rarely-used rules such as baseball’s infield fly rule.

### Courtesan {Metatech}
Courtesan is rarely a character's only Profession.
It's the art of attracting people of your preferred gender(s), having a good time out on the town with them, and perhaps taking them home for some snuggling.
Many people pick up a Tour or two of Courtesan, but only prostitutes and "escorts" do it for a living.

Specialized tasks for Courtesans are adult in nature.

### Criminal {Metatech}
Criminals know how to break the incredibly effective security measures found in the lower-technology civilizations, and how to run numbers or confidence scams that circumvent them in the high-tech civilizations.
They know other criminals, can critique law enforcement and security methods, and can sneak around to evade capture.

Almost all Criminal tasks are specialized.
Running a simple scam like three-card monte is not, but such things are unlikely to fool anyone in this age.

**Special Note**: This Profession is only available at character creation to those who belong to an organized crime group or society.
Others must purchase it during the game, through trial and error (imprisonment).

### Crisis Control {Nanotech}
Crisis Control includes firefighting, riot control, paramedic, and nanophage response training, as well as the ability to remain calm under fire and react quickly to danger. Crisis Control specialists are essential in any city, and can easily find work.

Responding to any sort of life-threatening event is a specialized task. In other words, if you really need Crisis Control, you’d better have it.

### Engineer (specific tech) {Cognitech}
Concentrations for this Profession are the five major technologies: Biotech, Cognitech, Metatech, Nanotech, and Stringtech.

Engineers do practical things with their technology of choice.
All engineers can create and critique the designs for devices or procedures that fall under their concentration.
Biotech engineers make living organisms or apply them to a given problem.
Cognitech engineers make Meshes and Foci.
Metatech engineers are active psychohistorians or culture designers.
Nanotech engineers work with construction, from bridges to nanophages.
Stringtech engineers make weapons, power plants, and starships.

All tasks for this Profession are considered specialized.
