# HIGH TECHNOLOGY RULES

## TECHNOLOGY TYPES

### BIOTECH
Derived from biology, biotech relates to living creatures and the systems that bind them together.

Biotech is unique in that it’s the only the technology that fully passes on to your descendents.
While certain items might require implantation (e.g. a pathogenesis organ), the vast majority of Biotech is written into your character’s DNA before birth.
High-Biotech civilizations know effective ways to make major changes after conception.

### COGNITECH
The study of cognitive science has given birth to cognitech: techniques and devices that influence one’s own mind.

### METATECH
Social science is a hard science in this day and age, as strongly grounded in mathematics as astronomy or biology.
Its techniques, devices, and methods are referred to as Metatechnology.

Metatech represents charisma, charm, savvy, force of will, and perfect inflection.

### NANOTECH
Nanotechnology is the application of physics, engineering, and chemistry to objects built on extremely small scales: a few billionths of a meter.

Nanotech allows for very detailed examination of an object or area — down to the microscopic level at Nanotech 5, or the molecular level at Nanotech 7. 
However, such examination is not fast, nor is it automatic.
Scrutinizing a crime scene ten feet across can take hours at the microscopic level, and days or even weeks at the molecular level.
Once you find what you’re looking for (say, a skin flake that might be from the criminal), there’s some more waiting to do before you can complete the DNA scan.
