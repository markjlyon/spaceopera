# THINGS OVERHEARD NEAR THE REPLICATOR

## GENERAL REASSIGNMENTS
Rumor has it that there will be a general reassignment of most Helm, Engineering, Navigation, and Operations personnel who can be replaced by Conclave personnel will be transferred to the Security branch due to recent losses.

## BABABRAHM
Rumor has it that Bababrahm will be releasing a series of experimental "biological" weapons to the USC for use against the Invaders and their dark matter caches, which would give the USC the ability to start destroying their resupply bases and begin to starve them out of specific systems.

## LT PETE OSMUND AND ENSIGN TRISHA OSMUND
Rumor has it that Lt Pete Osmund and Ensign Trisha Osmund are expecting a child! This would make their baby the 3rd new baby of the USC!

## LT COMMANDER PAMELA LOEWRY
Rumor has it that Lt Commander Loewry, who has been working very closely with Commander Brixton and Lieutenant Poots, has made a major breakthrough with the psionic amplifying artifact known as the L.E.N.S. but are keeping it hush hush.
