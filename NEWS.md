# PLANET NINE NEWS

## HERBAVISCIOUS
So the Salurian Confederation have begun a full blown civil war, if the reports by the Keptra are accurate. It appears the carnivores attempted to convince the herbavores to join the USC instead of rebuilding their war machines, but the herbavores unilaterally rejected it. Keptra long range sensors have picked up the fighting which appears to be moving toward Keptra space. No one really know why the civil war is advancing to the Keptra border, but the Keptra Empress is taking no changes and has placed the Keptra Empire on high alert. If the Keptra do anything well, its defend their borders with their unique technology. I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## A MARTYR MOST FOUL
Reports have slowly started coming in that might indicate the being known as Lord Foul survived his destruction and is approaching worlds not yet receiving USC and Sabra-Fenrir aid. They claim a dark savior appeared to them, offering food, medicine, and safety in return for the construction of altars and their regular homage. Zendai are not overly fond of bending the knee, but many fallen worlds are not Zendai. I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends! 

## NOSES MOST BLOODY
In what appears to be another in the series of government to government impressions, the USC seems to have taken some kind of pre-emptive action against the far away Highguardian fleet! Their noses fully bloodied, it looks like the alarm warnings the Highguardians send out to systems they are going to invade have been turned off and the last two most recently conquered worlds have been abandoned with great haste. Should the USC expect a counter offensive from a wormhole enabled fleet? Are they fearful of something else? I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## THE IMPOSSIBLE ALLY
What an impression the USC must have made folks! It looks like the Chigru, who said they could never join the USC, have done a complete 180! The Chigru have just announced a request of review for consideration for membership! There are going to be some ruffled feathers, as the Chigru still eat PEOPLE, but there is hope that some compromise of technology will finally be able to overcome this issue! Fingers and mandibles crossed everybody! I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## A POSSIBLE MOVE OF THE IMPERIAL THRONE
This is a strange one folks. There are solid rumors that there is talk of moving the Imperial Throne. No one has quite nailed down the why or when, but there is enough word on the grapevine to put it in the real possibility column. The Djinn Star Cluster is already really safe, so are they considering somewhere... safer? Maybe Empress Katerina likes the flora and fauna of a different world? No one has enough info yet, but my spies will keep at it until we know for sure. I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## BY THE PRICKING OF MY THUMB
There are recent rumors of Gorn ships being sighted in Sabra and Drago-Kadzai space, skulking around like lions in the bush. But these Gorn, although similar enough to be recognized as Gorn, are very different from those encountered before. Larger and at the same time leaner, they appear to be some new design. The Ventrasii seem to know nothing about these new kinds of ships or their capabilities. I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## IT WAS ALL A LIE
What a turn of events! Baroness Imogen Sabra wed Commander Harrison Rehnquist at Countess Alexandra and Kelvin's wedding! They tricked her into planning her own wedding! For those of you who don't know, nothing could have made her happier! Now they are on a blissful extended honeymoon making little Imogene's and Harrison's! Alexandra and Kelvin have announced their actual wedding will occur at the same venue in six months. I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## ALEXANDRA AND KELVIN TO WED
Holy maccaroni peeps! Angel's latest concert had such a heart warming finale! It looks like the new Countess, the wonderful and lovely Sabra sweetheart Alexandra is set to wed none other than Kelvin Bathe, brother of our new Marquess! Most women could only dream of such a proposal! It's set to go down at the Marquis and Marquess estate, the site of all the greatest weddings this century! I hear the great matchmaker Imogene Sabra set them up and now she is giving them the biggest wedding she has ever thrown! I expect a baby announcement soon! Now all I need to do is ask the ultra hot older sister Corina to marry me and that whole family comes off the market! No, I said I was going to ask her first! Ya snooze ya lose! I already lost the Baroness to that Sabra hunk and I don't plan on losing my dream PLUS fantasy girl Corina so easily! Fight me! I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## CORINA BATHE RESCUED FROM SERIAL KILLER RING
I was just told about a near tragic event by a psycho-terrorist group that captures young women for torture fantasy fulfillment and murder. Many of you might have received the same cryptic 505 alert from your pads or flexis. Grimaldi Labels President Corina Bathe was taken from a Sabra world while talent scouting but was rescued before they could bring their game with her to its finale. I can't even process how kin craz these people must be. Everyone involved has been captured, but it looks like this kidnap/rape/torture/murder ring might have many cells, one for each type of derranged fantasy. USC and Sabra-Fenrir security forces have applied considerable resources to locate and wipe out any other such rings. I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## HUMAN WARLIKE GOVERNMENT DISCOVERED
This is an interesting twist folks. A new government has been discovered in the Gamma quadrant and they are way more warlike than even the Drago-Kadzai! The weird thing is they appear to be a human only group, meaning no augments of any kind! No Zendai, no Carpathians, no Creasurians! We don't yet know about psionics or other naturally occurring evolutions. They appear to be a bunch of xenophobic land grabbing social blackholes! They can just go quark themselves! Release the Ying-Ko! Fire up the Battle Bride! Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## OLD ALIEN SPECIES / NEW NAME
So folks the Space Wars™ appear to be starting up again! Happy happy joy joy! Although history has given them many names, they are currently called the SPECTRAL. Sounds kinda like SoulDra but my spies inside the USC say they are a different, older species that have been around longer than humans. These Spectral have only been aggressive in the past and are kinda like the Ventrasii, in that they they never speak to anyone. It isn't known if they communicate with the Internecivus but it is suspected they must, since neither species ever attacks the other. They seem to be expanding their borders on some newly discovered human governments in the Gamma quadrant. USC to the rescue! At least this war will only last a few days! Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## UNITED SERVICE ORGANIZATION
The USC has instituted the United Service Organization (USO) to support and entertain our biological and non-biological service personnel! This is great news peeps because although Tony and Disasterpiece already served their tours of duty, Angelique and Stacy have only recently started their service and we would have lost them for at least 4 years if they couldn't do their tours in the USO! I imagine this will be true for most new entertainers with the new mandatory service requirements! Thank my lucky stars I already did my time before we joined the USC! Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## THE CHECKERED FLAG IS WAVED
People are lining by by the millions to get their licenses and try out for the upcoming VARLAR Cup Series exhibition races! This is where they separate the popped kernals from the unpopped folks! I have heard that the four big artists from Grimaldi are going to be there! Fast women, faster cars, and the fastest pours in the quadrant awaits us all! Maybe now that Baroness Emesyn has her figure back after squeezing out her kin, she can be a starter girl? In a tight and skimpy outfit? Hubba hubba make it rubba! Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## GIANT ALIEN PLANET KILLER DEFEATED
Why are we the last ones to know? So the weird vibes coming from the Chigru were, in fact, a cry for help. They lost over a hundred systems and a thousand worlds before the combined USC fleet was able to defeat a doomsday machine they called the Juggernaut! We were in the direct path of this thing peeps! If the USC hadn't stopped it in Chigru space it would have started wiping out our worlds as well! Everyone thank our boys and girls in grey, all the AIs and the Ventrasii people once again! Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## THE PRESIDENTIAL WEDDING
We have a new First Lady folks! The spicy little number from the same loins that brought us the Grimaldi Entertainment Manager Corina Bathe (marry me) and the delightful Baroness Alexandra's hunk of a charity director, Kelivn Bathe, seems to have grabbed onto the heart of the Triumverate Marquis Cirus Sabra like a bleeder hound with a locked jaw. The sexier than her syblings youngest sister Tiffiana Bathe has exchanged vows with the Marquis in the biggest wedding ceremony ever held on a space station! May December wedding you say?! More like Play Forever wedding! My spies behind the scenes tell me they are genuinely smitten with each other, like sensitive detected emotional mind reader genuine! News from the wedding party is the new Marquess was unexpectedly regal and charming, winning over most of the doubters at the gala! And let me tell you there were quite a few! Even her speech after the Marquis was truly memorable! That memory where he confessed "[He] fell in love with [her] the moment [she] rushed around that corner and accidentally fell into [his] arms" and knew from that moment on his life was no longer his own, was made even greater when she responded snarkily "I knew at that exact moment you were trouble. Serious trouble. Lucky for you I don't want to be saved." was priceless!  Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## KEPTRA USC MEMBERSHIP?
So, the Keptra Empress has officially applied for USC provisional membership and begun legal and cultural changes for the Keptra as a whole. The USC Empress has approved the request for expedited review. Talk about fast tracking something! The Keptra are going to have one heck of a time getting rid of their closed borders, slaves, and weird honor based caste system, but considering the alternatives in this day and age who wouldn't want the protection of the USC when half your fleet was lost to, well, the USC? Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## START YOUR ENGINES
The first ever Merdian III Cup Series is about to start! Drivers can test out their skills and repulsor racers in the new VARLAR School for Racing and get your official license! Tryouts begin in earnest for the first Cup! I already signed up so I will see you there! Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends! 

## BY THE PRICKING OF MY THUMBS
Time for some good old detective work my friends! Something has ruffled the Chigru and caused them to abandon their Meridan III consulate. Rumors are running wild like an opened bag of cats high on catnip! First they asked for a map of the whole USC and all its worlds, then they just pull up stakes and leave USC territory? Are they preparing for hostilities? They have been abiding by the Red Book almost religiously up to this point, so what changed? They helped out the USC during the FDK war, so it seems unlikely they would just turn against us? There's still some pieces missing. Maybe something is threatening them? Do some ground work peeps and let's get to the bottom of this! Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## CLAN SCORPION SURRENDERS
Well, well, well. It appears that one of the Keptra clans who lost their Dime-Yo-Yo-Yo, the scorpions, have decided to send a ~~hostage~~ diplomat so as to not anger the USC and lose any additional worlds to the Planetary Nut Cracker™. She is very apologetic and cooperative but it makes you wonder who's in charge of her clan and who is running the other beat down clans that also lost their Dime-Yo-Yo-Yos. Can we expect more clan ~~hostages~~ diplomats? What about visits from any new clan Dime-Yo-Yo-Yo's? Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## EMPRESS KATERINA I BEGINS HER SEARCH FOR A HUSBAND
It had to happen peeps! The beautiful, young, and desirable Empress of the USC, Her Imperial Majesty Katerina I, has put out a wide net in search of husband! Oh boy kids my time is NOW! This is going to be the longest audition line in human history! Everyone with a luxury farship, planetary garbage scowl, or even hot air balloon is going to find a way to get to Meridian I as fast as possible! Be still oh my Imperial Majesty's lovely heart! I am coming my Empress to become your Prince!

Oh wait! This just in! ... 

Well... sigh... ok so it looks like there is a list of suitors... and I am not on it... Ok people if you are on the list, the Imperial Palace will find you and comminicate their request to... you know what figure it out yourself ya lucky bastages... Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME
Now this is an interesting tidbit folks! The Chigru ambassadors have requested an updated map identifying all USC territory and member worlds to "prevent inherently dangerous accidental incidents"! Sure the USC has been more destructive now that in the last 1500 years, but that what this is all about? Haven't the Chigru been expanding their activities into FDK peace? It has been a peaceful, even helpful, foray to date but how long will that last? The Chigru have been very careful to abide by the agreement in that big red book, but will it last? Ponderous man, really ponderous. Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## KYRIE ELEISON
The new votes are in and tallied and we have a new Triumverate peeps! It looks like one of the USC AIs decided to throw their hat into the ring, winning every debate on style AND substance! Now they didn't win by a landslide like our other two Trimuverate members, but they did win by a large enough margin not to perform a recount! She is the former Ship Made Flesh of the long gone USC Kyrie Eleison, a mobile hospital and medical treatment farship, so she is an AI built for compassion and empathy! With a brain the size of a planet! Who could be a better Triumverate than an unbribable, un-thought-readable, compassionate, artificial intelligence?! Well the voters certainly thought so! Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!  

## CHIGRU
Surprise, surpise, the Chigru appear to be stablizing the FDK worlds near their own borders! They are bringing much needed supplies and aid to the populations there! They are even helping kickstart agriculture again by suppying seeds and livestock! I thought their livestock was people, but they are bringing big meat animals! What is most surprising is this: THEY AREN'T CAPTURING AND EATING PEOPLE!!! Most people believe this isn't a question of IF but of WHEN. What do you think folks? Think the Chigru are being truly altruistic, or is there something more sinister lurking beneath the surface? Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## KEPTRA HOSTAGES
Well, well, well, the defeated Keptra Clans have kept their collective word and sent formal hostages to the USC after their crushing defeat! I know the Conclave sent hostages in return, but I have no details yet. Hold on to your testees people, we are about to get our first real contact with a 2500 year old culture! They look like us, but how much are they realy like us? There appear to be some sensitives among them so I hope our own sensitive police are up to the task! Five girls and two boys from the seven clans! I have heard that they even speak two brand new languages! But the questions are, could they be spies, can they be trusted, and how will they treat the hostages we sent them? Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## A TALE OF TAILS
Take your tin foils hats out kiddos and dust them off, because something strange is happening in the neighborhood! Numerous reports have been trickling in from all over USC space, both inside and outside the shatterzone, of strange streaks of blue light tearing across space that appear to be created by, well, nothing, and leaving no trace evidence behind! They don't seem to have a pattern or source, and if the silence from the USC means anything, they must be something really important or really dangerous! Do we have a new threat to deal with peeps?! If so, since they can appear inside the shatterzone it might be something really dangerous! But mums the word from any official source! My drones are all silent on the topic! Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends! 

## CIRUS SABRA
Holy macaroni peeps! The Triumverate Marquis Cirus Sabra is apparently planning for a WEDDING! Caterers and wedding planners are all preparing his old estate for the nuptuals! Word has it that he didn't pick a noble Sabra as his bride! It isn't clear exactly who it is, but my little drones tell me it isn't going to be anyone we expect! He has apparently hidden this mystery woman from his own family and staff! Bets are on folks! Is it a Fenrir? Is it a human? Maybe a USC member? Kinhel, might they even be one of those dead sexy fembots?!? Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## PIRATES STOPPED BY CHIGRU FORCES
What an unexpected turn of events! The Chigru have sent out fleets deep into FDK space to take out the pirates plaguing those defenseless worlds too far away for the USC to help! There is talk of the Chigru starting building bases to create a supply line back to Chigru space and allow a more permanent presence. The Chigru ambassadors have assured the USC the Red Book will still be honored. Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## USC UNDERGOING MASSIVE CHANGES
Well that didn't take long folks! Now that the Triumverate and Empress elections have been decided, the Executive branch went into full swing with the military! A massive reorganization with personnel changes, reorganized ship construction priorities, reassignment of ships on the line! It looks like the whole USC military is about to become leaner and smaller?! Why this is necessary in a post-scarcity society blows the mind peeps! Why do we need fewer and less powerful ships? Especially with how many recent fights our military have had to deal with lately! Somethin ain't right on Meridian! Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends! 

## ALLICROCIGATORS
So the Ventrasii appear to be under attack from a race of living starships! Word around the fleet is that these "Gorn" invaders actually EAT starships! The attack was so bad it appears the Ventrasii have abandoned their space out on the rim and consolidated at the USC battle station! There must be tens of thousands of Ventrasii ships cloaked and sneaking around protecting the base. The truly sad thing is it looks like these "Gorn" went after the reproduction centers of the Ventrasii, eating all their young and unborn. The Ventrasii around the station might be all that is left if they can't find a safe place to reproduce, how ever that works for such an alien species. 

## THREE DAY MUSIC FESTIVAL
Grimaldi Labels will host a three day musical festival, THREE DAYS IN PARADISE, on the USC captial world of Merdian III. Headliners will include Stacy Star, Tony Rich, and... ANGEL (marry me?)!!! There will also be numerous new and up and coming acts all day long! Food and drink will be provided but for drugs you are on your own! There will be a showcase of stock race repulsor vehicles for everyone to check out! Get this - we will get the first look at the GIANT FRICKING COMBAT ROBOTS courtesty of the Great White Fight Robonautics Corporation of Carpathia! Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## COUNTESS ROSETTE SHOCK TRIAL OF THE CENTURY
I knew I should have predicted a shocking outcome earlier because guess what kids, we have the most unbelievable, mind blowing, trid-like soap opera ending in a court case you have ever heard! First, the Countess did get a surprise defense council in the form of an old, and I mean old, family friend - the honorable Perry Mattlock! 119 and out of retirement nobody thought his involvement would do anything but hurt her odds! This sombich pulled out the mother of all rabbits from his hat of tricks folks! It turns out the Countess was being controlled by the Sabra-Fenrir's own court sensitive the Seer! Cut to the chase - the Seer wanted to destroy the Sabra and when the union of the Sabra-Fenrir happened, she just kin snapped! She tried to kill the Oracle to hide her activities and used the innocent Countess to do her dirty work attacking Sabra nobles and their friends! If it wasn't for an old man's faith in the Countess and his hours of dilligent combing through the evidence, the Seer would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for you, you ancient book worm! He just danced around that courtroom, handing the prosecution loss after loss! Using his own words against him and feeding him several crow pies! What a thing of beauty it was to witness! Hopefully the Countess can forgive us for overlooking her years of noblesse oblige and ever doubting her innocence. That still leaves the scary matter of sensitives powerful enough to control the people we love, even fooling the Oracle! Are there even more powerful sensitives outside the USC we aren't even aware of? Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## THE VOTES ARE IN
In what is perhaps the fastest and safest turnaround on an election we have ever seen, the votes for Triumverate are tallied and we have our new Executive leaders girls and boys! Our Executive Elect are from the Sabra-Fenrir, Carpathian Oceanic Alliance, and USC itself! The winners in order of the most votes:

* Marquis Virus Sabra
* Franz Ruhl
* Wilson Clark

Now let's get busy re-establishing our imperial monarchy! Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## COUNTESS ROSETTE COMMITS TREASON
They have arrested the Countess Rosette Sabra for crimes against the Sabra-Fenrir throne and people!!! It appears she was behind many seemingly unrelated events throughout the USC designed to cause havoc and political damage, and even death! How did she do this my peeps? Get your tin foil hats ready folks... Not only is she not a Zendai, it turns out she is also a powerful sensitive!!! Attacking political alliances, striking women barren, attempting to destroy relationships of her rivals! She even tried to kill the beloved Oracle! Although the trial is locked down tight, my sources tell me she has already confessed to these crimes and more! No council will defend her for any amount of latinum! Every public defender has come up with a reason to recuse themselves! A confession and no defense?! Get ready for a hangin of a noble people! Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## GIANT FRIGGING COMBAT ROBOTS
Giant. Frigging. Combat. Robots. I can't possibly get more erect! Not only is Meridian opening itself up for the VARLAR racing league, they are adding monster mecha combat and some kind of mecha sports-ball! What a time to be alive! Can anyone join in? Can I pilot while looping select simsense segments from Battle Bride?

## COUNTESS ROSETTE SABRA IS HUMAN AND STILL THE SEXIEST MOST PERFECT ZENDAI WOMAN
Did we all wake up in alternate timeline this morning?! Or has it just become so fashionable to be a human noble that people are now just choosing to identify as human?! Well it turns out the Sabra family has now come forward with the truth that Countess Rosette has been a human all this time! The perfect Sabra woman has always been human! Polling is all over the place on this one folks! Some people hate being lied to for decades and others love the fact that a normal human as helped guide the Sabra to a more accepting and equality based society!

Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## BATTLE BRIDE BREAKS ALL RECORDS
Having experienced the Baroness, I mean the  premiere, myself with a box of tissues and a bottle of lotion I can definitively state this release will dwarf the lauded and respected Neil the Heavy Worlder Barbarian series of simtrids!

## HISTORY REPEAT, ADJACENT
Hello friends and has it been a crazy few weeks! That rumored Zendai ghost ship was actually, in fact, a ghost ship! Former phantoms from the past, specifically the Zendai Empire, have travelled into the present over two thousand years! Unlike the USS Celestia with its ring around the black disc trip, the HMS Sequoia was trapped massless at near superluminal speeds for a double dose of millenia! All while fleeing to report on the arrival of the SOULDRA! Kinhel! Even though it looks like the Zendai Empire and USC have worked everything out, how well do we really know these original Zendai? And what do they think of today's Zendai? Will they try to restore the Empire? Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

Drago-Kadzai rebels? Who knows! Who cares! Let the Battle Bride sort it out! Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## GHOST SHIP SPOTTED IN FORMER DRAGO-KADZAI SPACE
This is quite mysterious friends. Sightings are begining to pile up about an ancient ghost ship spotted around several FDK systems including the Drago-Kadzai throne world! Are there some angry spirits enraged by the extremely embarrassing massive loss against the USC? Maybe one of the 500 year old ships escaped the battle? If it isn't a ghost ship, why is it flying the ancient colors of the old Imperium? Keep listening as I bring everything in the black out into the light! Stay strange my friends!

## THE DISAPPEARING DOZEN
First it was rumors that a dozen or more FDK worlds had fallen silent! At first we thought maybe local struggles for power, but all these close worlds all at the same time!? Next we got spooky recordings of "something" sending messages from the silent DK worlds. Now we have trid! Now we know! Behold the real culprit! Da Lizzad People!

## SOULDRA PUBLIC DATA DUMP GIVES CONSPIRACY THEORISTS THEIR FIRST ERECTIONS
