# USC CELESTIA CAMPAIGN
It is the year 12185 and USC launches the last of its deep space battleships, the Celestia.
Answering a distress call in the Hadron Expanse the Celestia comes under surprise attack and is forced into the orbit of a black ring,
an orbit which traps the Celestia suspended in time,
an orbit which doesn't free her until over 500 years later...

# CAMPAIGN HISTORY
IN THE BEFORE
The year was 12185.
It was the Golden Age of Mankind and the greatest post-scarcity period of human history.
There was no hunger, no disease, no galactic war.
In a galaxy of peace no one could predict the Zendai betrayal.

# IN THE NOW
The year is now 12702. The USC is nothing but a myth after 517 years. The Zendai betrayal of the galaxy lasted over a century as they hunted down and destroyed any non-Zendai races, governments, cities, fleets, bases, and technologies. Ten thousand years of social and technological progress have been lost. The galaxy has now barely 15% of its 12185 human population due to Zendai planetary genocides, slavery, and increasingly hostile alien attacks. The once proud Zendai Empire's government is gone, replaced thousands of barbaric feudal warlords.

Relations with all alien races are now unfriendly at best.

## THE ZENDAI
The Zendai are a self proclaimed offshoot of humanity and an entirely new race, defined by a specific group of genetic augmentations propgated by one of the most intelligent and charismatic humans to ever live, Drago Ivani. They are gifted with superior senses, bodies, and minds at the cost of a lack of empathy and the genetic loss of the ability to use psionics. Once the proud members of their own vast galactic empire, they have devolved into thousands of barbaric prides ruled by mostly bloodthirsty hedonistic warlords. 

Before the Zendai betrayal no one believed that they could unify beyond small groups of a few thousand for any length of time. It was thought that their great egos and desire to rule those they deemed inferior was an impassable barrier to becoming a galactic power. Their critics were both right and wrong. While the Zendai did manage to coordinate under a single leader, Emperor Deth O'Kay, to eliminate the USC, FWA, and other governments and alien civilizations, they could not remain united after Emperor Deth O'Kay's mysterious disappearance.

When the Zendai successfully overthrew the United Star Corps and Federated Worlds Alliance between 12185 to 12218, it was because they had spent the last century secretly building hundreds of thousands of warships. They coordinated their initial surprise attacks to devastating effect. The capitals, shipyards, manufacturing systems, and supply depots were all struck first, crippling the USC and FWA ability to coordinate a response, repair or construct new ships, or resupply. High levels of technology were not the goal or even needed by the Zendai. They only needed enough ships with enough firepower to win their engagements. Their losses were heavy but they swarmed and destroyed every major target successfully. It was a war of attrition with cheap light fast star ships equipped with less expensive weapons against vastly technologically superior fleets, but they outnumbered each encounter 1000 or more to one and it was more than enough to crush their enemies.

The galaxy has entered a new dark ages. The Zendai systematically destroyed all technology and manufaturing on every world they could find, and they were exceedingly thorough. The Zendai are now fractured into thousands of minor warlords, all of whom use a two class system of Zendai or non-Zendai. Zendai are the leaders and warriors. Everyone else is a slave or starving on some long forgotten world depleted of its resources.

Zendai are cruel, savage, brutal, and treacherous. And they love their children.

### THE ZENDAI WARLORDS
The Zendai warlords fight constantly, unless they join forces temporarily against an alien threat or bigger Zendai fleet. Zendai are the only humans that know limited freedom, all other humans either barely scrape an existence from their scorched worlds or they are slaves to their Zendai warlords. The amount of freedom a Zendai enjoys is based on the purity of their bloodline and their record of military accomplishments. Normal humans have no such luxury.

The Zendai do no manual or mental labor, instead relying entirely on their enslaved races for all production and maintenance in their society. There is no technological research. There are no advancements. The slaves only produce enough to keep their warlords happy and supplied with a functional fleet. Even the slave that created the Heel Nipper, a weapon used on most large Zendai fleets, was executed as a message to all other slaves that innovation, or any improvement upon existing Zendai culture, is a weakness that warrants death. The current level of Zendai technology echos back to that from eight or nine millennia ago.

#### THE DRAGO-KADZAI PRIDE - MIGHT MAKES RIGHT
The Drago-Kadzai Pride is the most powerul pride in this quadrant of the galaxy. They rule through fear and cruelty, destroying whole continents at a mere whisper of rebellion. They raid their slave worlds in cycles giving them just enough time recover from the last raid before their people and resources are raided again. They are ruled, like most Zendai prides, by Zendai noble houses. The Drago-Kadzai care only about power and control, and are extremists when it comes to their genetic purity and lineage, and are defined as much by military success as their genetics.

Leader: Drago-Kadzai Landsraad, composed of 12 families.

The Drago-Kadzai have the 1st largest known fleet in the galaxy. Their fleet is primarily made up of large groups of smaller, faster strike frigates and destroyers as they rely on surprise and numbers for victory.

#### THE FENRIR PRIDE - THE ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS
The Fenrir Pride is the second most powerful pride in this quadrant of the galaxy. They are known for their almost supernatural political and economic prowess and value pleasure and wealth over military victories. Similar to all Zendai cultures, they have a two caste social system but the quality of life as a Fenrir slave is significantly better than that of all other Zendai prides. They have a very structured noble society and are currently ruled by their Grand Duke who rules with absolute power. Some slaves who catch the eye of a Fenrir superior through their beauty or service can find themselves with almost as much freedom as a Zendai.

Leader: Grand Duke Alexios Kaminos

The Fenrir have the 4th largest known fleet in the galaxy. They are the only known Zendai fleet to make heavy use of fighters and fast patrol ships and most of their fleets function as small carriers and tenders.

#### THE SABRA PRIDE - ALL IS FAIR IN LOVE AND WAR
The Sabra pride is the Third most powerful pride in this quadrant of the galaxy. They are known for being extremely decadent hedonists and bloodthristy warriors. Conquests in the bedroom seem to hold as much value as conquests on the battlefield. The Sabra pride is very focused on eugenics and improving their own genetic superiority as well as breeding their slaves for high appearance and stamina. Only a tiny percentage of the most attractive slaves live somewhat comfortable lives as concubines and breeding stock, while those considered unattractive or unappealing live oppressed solitary lives without the opportunity to find a mate. They are ruled by a single matriarchal family, the Sabra, although they rule by council without a true single leader.    

Leader: Sabra Family Council

The Sabra have the 6th largest known fleet in the galaxy. Their fleet is comprised almost entirely of light and heavy cruisers and they rely heavily on minelaying tactics.

## THE CHIGRU - UNITY IN DIVERSITY, STRENGTH IN NUMBERS
The insectoid race known as the Chigru were diplomatically aligned with the USC. The elimination of the USC ended the peace with humanity and the Chigru. Over the last 400 years they have returned to their warlike ways against humanity, taking and either eating or egg laying all human captives. The Chigru are ruled by their Queen Light of Day Meets Dark of Night, although day to day administration actually falls to the administrative caste. The Chigru know no slavery or social inequality, except for the Queen and her mates. They do not keep slaves of other races but do use captives for food and egg laying.

Although the Zendai destroyed their worlds and technology, much as they did for the rest of humanity, the Chigru did not sit back idly. Harboring their long racial memories, once the Zendai attacks against their worlds lessened due to Zendai infighting, they began to rebuild their technology and manufacturing. Although nowhere near their height of 12185, they are still more advanced than the Zendai. Due to their low numbers and limited resourcs, the Chigru fleet is comprised of only five types of vessels: frigates, destroyers, tugs, cruisers, and dreadnaughts. The Chigru do not have small freighters or transports like other races, instead relying solely on their armed tugs with very large cargo capacities. In some cases both the tug cargo pods are replaced with heavy weapons platforms, essentially turning these battle tugs into ships with firepower somewhere between a cruiser and a dreadnaught, but without the speed and maneuverability. The Chigru fleet is small but its ships are powerful, and they rarely travel in small numbers and never without purpose. Drago-Kadzai and Sabra attacks into Chigru territory have been met with mostly failure, and Chigru attacks into Drago-Kadzai and Sabra space have also been met with mostly failure. It seems, at the moment, they are at a stalemate.

Leader: Queen Light of Day Meets Dark of Night

The Chigru have a small but powerful fleet of technologicallly advanced ships, for 12702. They rely heavily on point defense systems against drones and fighters, and are rumored to have developed several powerful and new technologies, not known even before 12185. 

## THE KZINTI - FOR AN HONOR GREATER THAN OURSELVES
The feline-like race known as the Kzinti were never enemies of humanity until the Zendai betrayal. Now the entire race is dedicated to the elimination of the Zendai. They have been known to kill all Zendai on a ship yet spare all human slaves. Their scanning technology to identify Zendai is second to none.

Like the Chigru, the Kzinti are working hard to restore their lost technologies and are constantly testing them against any bordering Zendai barbarians.

## SILURIAN
The reptilian race known as the Silurians were never enemies of humanity until the Zendai betrayal. In the centuries that have passed they have consolidated into a handful of difficult to assault star systems, slowly building their fleets and technology. They have maintained their deadly plasma technologies and have some of the largest and toughest ships built since the Fall.

## VENTRASII
The Ventrasii race was almost brought to extinction by the Zendai betrayal. Even with vastly superior ships and weapons, the sheer numbers of the Zendai were too much. The Zendai spent a great deal of effort to genocide the Ventrasii, reducing their numbers from the trillions to the millions. But like the Silurians, they have bided their time restoring their technology and fleets for when they begin to reconquer their lost worlds. Recent new technological advancements indicate a rematch against the Zendai would turn out very differently.

# 12185 TECHNOLOGY
The following technologies are only available to ships constructed prior to 12185. Ships constructed later can only use 12675 technology.

## DEFENSIVE SYSTEMS
### POWER ABSORPTION PANELS
Power Absorption Panels (PAs) are an incredibly advanced replacement for old shield technologies. While shields simply provide a buffer to mitigate incoming damage, PA panels convert that incoming damage into reusable energy.

A ship with PA panels can't equip or use shields or deflectors.

## WEAPONS SYSTEMS
### ADVANCED PHASER TECHNOLOGIES
Improvements in energy efficiency and advanced targeting allow for the use of Type G, Type 1, Type 4, Type 5, and Type M phaser weapons.

## FTL SYSTEMS
### FAR GATES - NEARLY INSTANTANEOUS TRAVEL BETWEEN TWO FIXED GATES
Far gates connect two distant points in space by the use of two gigantic far gates, one each end of the journey. They require vast amounts of energy but allow a star ship to travel from one gate to the other almost instantly.

### TRANS-WARP DRIVE - UP TO 1 HOUR/LIGHT YEAR
Trans-warp drive technology allows a star ship to travel vast distances an order of magnitude faster than warp drive. It is lighter, cheaper, and vastly more efficient than classic warp drives.

Trans-warp drive star ships can engage with both STL and FTL star ships.

### QUANTUM DRIVE - UP TO 25 LIGHT YEARS/HOUR
Quantum drives are the precursor to the quantum slip stream drive but are still useful enough to be in regular service.

Quantum drive star ships can engage with both STL and FTL star ships.

### QUANTUM SLIP STREAM DRIVE - UP TO 150 LIGHT YEARS/HOUR
Quantum slip stream drives are the pinnacle of non-instantaneous FTL drive systems.

Quantum slip stream drive star ships can engage with both STL and FTL star ships.

# 12702 TECHNOLOGY
Due to the Zendai exterminating most the inhabited worlds in the galaxy, both human and alien, and their complete lack of interest in technology the galaxy has fallen into a social and technological dark ages. Almost all advanced star ship systems are unrepairable due to age or lost knowledge. The Zendai use their slaves to build and maintain their fleets using "current" technology. Although a handful of alien worlds have begun the long slow process to rebuild their lost technologies, most human worlds are feudal socialist kingdoms and have no interest or resources to do the same. The Zendai believe that outnumbering an enemy 100 to 1 is far more important that having some technological advantage over them, as the fall of the USC seems to have proved.

Ships and technologies of this time period are built by slaves without the automation of nanites or programmable matter, so they are very limited in their quality and efficiency.

## DEFENSIVE SYSTEMS
### DEFLECTORS
Deflectors work by attempting to deflect damage away from the ship. They can only mitigate small amounts of damage at a time. Unlike shields, deflectors are either on or off. Deflectors were abandoned with the invention of PA panels.

A ship with deflectors can't equip or use shields or PA panels.

### EXPANDING SPHERE GENERATORS
Expanding sphere generators (ESG) are designed to damage and eliminate incoming physical objects like asteroids, fighters, and other star ships. ESGs can have their radii set 0km to 30000km with damage decreasing based on the size of the sphere. It has no effect on energy weapons fired into or out of the ESG field.

The ESG is usable by any ship if it can find and mount it, regardless of year.

### SHIELDS
Shields are the first version of a energy based defensive system for damage mitigation. Shields are a form of ablative electromagnetic, gravity, and force based fields designed to prevent incoming damage and energy. They become disrupted after taking damage and require time to repair their reduced capacity. Shields can receive surplus energy to help mitigate additional damage, but only up to their current strength. Shields were abandoned with the invention of PA panels.

A ship with shields can't equip or use deflectors or PA panels.

## WEAPONS SYSTEMS
### DISRUPTORS
Disruptors of 12675 are much weaker than previous generations of disruptors. Disruptors can't be overloaded.

### DISRUPTOR CANNONS
Disruptor cannons, the far weaker precursor to the now lost disruptor technology, are one of the most common energy weapons of 12675.

### DRONES AND MISSILES
Drone and missile technology of 12675 are very low tech weapons with very low speed and damage.

Death-bolt missiles are the most advanced missiles and available only to the Zendai, but are only equivalent to the most basic drones of 12185.

### HEEL NIPPER
Strangely, this weapon is a new technology created by slaves in service of some Zendai warlord. It works by directly attacking any hyper, warp, or quantum engine directly through the fabric of spacetime and bypasses deflectors, shields, PA panels, and force fields. It only targets and damages FTL engines. It has an extremely short range and is highly inaccurate. It causes one engine box to be destroyed and causes the ship to turn into the shot, if a left or right engine was hit. If multiple heel nippers successfully hit the same drive at the same time, only the first heel nipper hit has any effect. This is the current limit of heel nipper technology.

### MAULER
Maulers are a very ancient technology that has been successfully resurrected for use in 12675. It draws power from a ship's reserves and engines and hurls that energy at a single target. The weapon is devastating at close range, but loses damage quickly over range. Ships that fire too much energy in a single shot can suffer shock to their internal systems.

### PHASERS
Phasers of Type 1 are used only on bases with gravity stabilizers and are the most power energy weapon of 12675.

Phasers of Type 2 are the most powerful phaser available for star ships.

Phasers of Type 3 are the most common type of phaser for star ships.

### PHOTON TORPEDOES
Photon torpedoes of 12675 are much weaker than previous generations of photon torpedoes. Photon torpedoes can't be overloaded. Photon torpedoes can't be proximity.

### PLASMA TORPEDOES
Plasma torpedoes are a very ancient technology that has been successfully resurrected for use in 12675. They come in various power types from F, G, S, and R. There is no type D plasma torpedo in 12675.

### QUANTUM WAVE TORPEDOES
Quantum wave torpedoes are a recent development by some of the alien races. It operates in a similar fashion to a plasma torpedo, but on impact splashes its damage across multiple shield arcs. Quantum wave torpedoes come in only a single type.

### WARP TARGETED LASERS
Warp targeted lasers are a precursor to the phaser. They are easy to manufacture but have a short range and low damage. They are capable of targeting and hitting FTL vessels like a phaser.

### FTL SYSTEMS
JUMP DRIVE - 1 TO 6 PARSECS IN ~168 HOURS
The original FTL drive technology. All travel using a jump drive, regardless of distance, takes 168 hours +/- 10%. It requires about 30 minutes to properly calculate the jump destination. It takes about 30 minutes for a jump drive to cool down enough to be used again. A jump requires enough ship energy to move a ship speed 8. Pre-existing jump calculations between two well known points do exist, reducing the calculations to 5 minutes.

Jump drive ships can't engage with STL or FTL star ships.

### HYPER DRIVE - 20 MINUTES * DRIVE RATING PER 32.7 LIGHT YEARS
The first time and distance based FTL drive technology. It requires about 1-5 minutes to properly calculate a hyper space destination. A hyper drive trip requires enough ship energy to move a ship a speed of 12.

Hyper drive ships can't engage with STL or FTL star ships.

### HYPER SPACE FOLD GENERATOR - NEARLY INSTANTANEOUS
Hyper space fold generators move a ship instantly between two points in space. It requires several minutes to plot a course between folds. Requires a 32 minute wait period between folds. A hyper space fold generator requires enough ship energy to move a ship a speed of 6. A hyper space fold generator can travel a maximum of 137 light years per fold.

Hyper drive ships can't engage with STL or FTL star ships.

### WARP DRIVE - UP TO 6 HOURS/LIGHT YEAR
The first FTL drive technology that allows a ship to interact with both STL and FTL targets. It requires a few seconds to enter warp and a destination can be altered in real time.

Warp drive star ships can engage with both STL and FTL star ships.
