# THINGS OVERHEARD NEAR THE REPLICATOR

## AMBASSADOR BARONESS ROCHELLE
Rumor has it that the Sabra-Fenrir have chosen Baroness Rochelle to be their official Ambassador. She is currently setting up quarters on the battle station in the diplomatic wing with her personnel and has made it a point to meet with USC command, Dominique, all the other ambassadors, and the crew of the Sequoia. She spent most of her time with Dominique and the crew of the Sequoia.

## AMBASSADOR PORTIA
Rumor has it that the Ventrasii Ambassador Portia abruptly left the observation lounge to walk to the docking ring of an arriving Zendai passenger ship. A man disembarked that she started to shadow. He appeared not to notice her following him a a close 2 meters distance. People tried to talk to Portia, who they never before saw just walking around the station, but she would politely excuse herself each time and keep following. He must have been spooked by having people periodically speak to someone he couldn't see or hear, including in the men's rest room, so he made a hasty retreat to the passenger ship without having done anything on the station and stayed on it until it departed. Portia just returned to the observation lounge as if nothing happened.

## ZOE MARCHANT
Rumor has it that Cmdr Marchant and Captain Cade were supposed to get married once she received her new posting as captain of her own vessel, but they have postponed the wedding since their arrival due to her still being his XO.

## 117 MILLION
Rumor has it that most of the 117 million refugees from the deadly star cluster have lost their ability to reproduce, with those who still can facing a high risk of birth defects, due to the long term effects of the radiation. People outside the 177 million seem to be avoiding getting into any kind of serious relationships with the refugees. 

## PEYTON HUNTER
Rumor has it that Cmdr Peyton Hunter had a long conversation with Baroness Imogene after the party behind closed doors, but no one knows the topic or who initiated the conversation.

## YING-KO
Rumor has it Ying-Ko was stopped moments before he could murder Baron Primus by the Baroness Emesyn. The Imperial Zendai lower ranking crew members seem to approve of his attemptedurder, but understand why he had to be stopped.

## COMMANDER ASHWOOD
Rumor has it Cmdr Ashwood had her ice cold heart melted by Cmdr Tannhauser on the night of the party. They were seen slow dancing cheek to cheek, sitting close together at a table, and leaning in close to whisper and laugh softly to one another. She was seen being a lady; demure in speech and manner, exuding tenderness and frailty, revealing a soft feminine side no one has ever seen before.

## ALIEN VISITORS
Rumor has it the alien visitor guests of the alien Shara discovered the joys of dancing and love making. Kiari seems to have embraced dancing with a lead, being completely submissive, allowing her every action to be controlled by her partner. Tarna seems to have equally embraced lovemaking, being virginal and submissive, allowing her every action to be controlled by her lover. Tarna has received a large number of offers to experience new lovers.

## VENTRASII AMBASSADOR
Rumor has it the Ventrasii Ambassador Portia is as freaky in the sheets as she is in the streets. Her lover, Yeoman Butler, is a changed man who claims his experience with her was like a religious epiphany. She used him in ways that would surprise even the Sabra. He says he never met a woman as experienced, controlling, and with such a dirty mouth. People wonder if she is monogamous or if it was just sex and she is willing to take additional lovers.

## BARON PRIMUS
Rumor has it that Baron Primus groped an old school Zendai junior officer, then ordered her to have sex with him, all while in front of her crew and attendees of the party. He was forced to make a public apology and landed himself in prison for several months. The Marquis is so furious he is considering Revocation of Nobility for the Baron.

## ZENDAI IMPERIALS
Rumor has it that the current Zendai are already trying to latch on to these Imperial Zendai to improve their children's genetic profile. The captain is already taken, but with over 290 candiates its first come first serve.

## SHARA'S GUESTS
Rumor has it that Shara has restricted access to her disc because she has three guests on her ship. Shara and the first two guests seemed to smile and laugh and casually socialize, but this new third guest seems to have Shara stressing out.

## BABY SEX BETTING
Rumor has it that someone is so confident about the sex of the Baron and Baroness babies that they have laid down a SIZABLE bet among several bookmakers across the quadrant.

## SILURIAN THREAT
Rumor has it that there is contention among the senior officers in the USC about when and how to help the currently un-devastated worlds close to the Silurian occupation. Some want to help the closest worlds suffering the most first, while others want to bloody the noses of the lizards because each world they take gives them fleet construction as well as closer proximity to the worlds we saved before them.

## ZENDAI IMPERIALS
Rumor has it that the Imperial Zendai consider most of the current Zendai in the quadrant as "troglodytes", barely worthy of being called Zendai. Publically they seem treat everyone with courtesy and respect, even if they seem a bit distant and reserved to anyone not from their own empire.
