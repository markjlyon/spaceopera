# THINGS OVERHEARD NEAR THE REPLICATOR

## ZENDAI IMPERIALS
Rumor has it that the current Zendai are already trying to latch on to these Imperial Zendai to improve their children's genetic profile. The captain is already taken, but with over 290 candiates its first come first serve.

## SHARA'S GUESTS
Rumor has it that Shara has restricted access to her disc because she has three guests on her ship. Shara and the first two guests seemed to smile and laugh and casually socialize, but this new third guest seems to have Shara stressing out.

## BABY SEX BETTING
Rumor has it that someone is so confident about the sex of the Baron and Baroness babies that they have laid down a SIZABLE bet among several bookmakers across the quadrant.

## SILURIAN THREAT
Rumor has it that there is contention among the senior officers in the USC about when and how to help the currently un-devastated worlds close to the Silurian occupation. Some want to help the closest worlds suffering the most first, while others want to bloody the noses of the lizards because each world they take gives them fleet construction as well as closer proximity to the worlds we saved before them.

## ZENDAI IMPERIALS
Rumor has it that the Imperial Zendai consider most of the current Zendai in the quadrant as "troglodytes", barely worthy of being called Zendai. Publically they seem treat everyone with courtesy and respect, even if they seem a bit distant and reserved to anyone not from their own empire.
