# THINGS OVERHEARD NEAR THE REPLICATOR

## RYSZARD BOSCH
Rumor has it that Ensign Ryszard Bosch has requested a transfer to Security from the PSICorps. Details are sketchy but it seems he thinks the PSICorps isn't the right fit for him, because his psionics are very different and they "spend too much time in other peoples heads". Supposedly they asked him to stay and would tweak his assignment for him, but he seems pretty adamant. Perhaps they will put him in the same squad as Martin Balsim, aka "Sledgehammer", to maybe keep him in check so he doesn't hurt anyone else?

## ISOBEL DUKE
Rumor has it that Lt Cmdr Isobal Duke has started dating Bismark. Yes, that Bismark. She started hanging out with Captain Zoe Marchant once she was given command of the battle cruiser and just kept hanging around. It appears now we know why.

## PORTIA
Rumor has it that Portia, the Ventrasii ambassador, is looking for a romantic partner? What? Isn't she a cringy alien? Isn't she always evasive about her people's motives and culture? Do they do human sacrifce? Is she going to lay eggs in her partner? What kind of man, knowing her history, could have any interest in her? People are talking about her very recent change in appearance and behavior, and we could see how someone would be attracted to her. But marry? Seems impossible given other rumors about her.

## MANDATORY SERVICE
Rumor has it that the USC will implement mandatory service starting in about a month, and will require a 4 year military service commitment or an 8 year social service commitment if you can't or won't do the military service. People are mostly on board with it because right now the USC military is a very romantic notion and is seen in a really positive light, others are happy because they like idea of purposeful social service, and the rest because they really have nothing better to do and like the idea of being able to vote and own land. Mandatory age ranges are, depending on human genome type or race, from 16 to 32. They will allow for some exceptions that postpone the date, but all must eventually serve.

## ANGEL, STACY, AND TONY
Rumor has it that the Grimaldi Labels tours with Angelique, Stacy, and Antony were a resounding success! It culminated in a final tour stop at the battle station where all three groups performed together! All personnel that wanted the time off to see the final performance had it granted, with The Oracle providing assurances about safety and hundreds androids carrying on the basic maintenance work during any personnel absences.

## EMPRESS KATERINA I
Rumor has it that the USC Empress has officially moved her residence to the USC Celestia for the forseeable future. She doesn't command it or interfere with the activities of the ship, its just that she feels she needs to be ready to quantum anywhere at a moments notice. No one is quite sure how this will affect her search for a husband.

## PORTIA
Rumor has it that the Ventrasii ambassador Portia has been hanging around the USC Captains and the CEO of Grimaldi. It seems to have started after a distant trip near or to Chigru space. She went into her shuttle, back to her ship the Peacock, spent several days there, then returned an absolutely driven person, injecting herself into all the meetings and discussions she can. She rarely says anything, but when she does it is direct, detailed, on point, and missing any sense of evasion. She still doesn't answer personal or cultural questions, but her responses have now become things like "How does answering that help us?" or "We have more important things to think about". If any ship USC ship leaves, she and several Ventrassi ships decloak at the battle station and go with them. Maybe they don't go with Grimaldi ships because they are too fast?

## VENTRASII
Rumor has it that the Ventrasii now occupy 6 worlds inside the cluster and began laying eggs or fertilizing eggs or making coccoons or something. How could the USC or Grimaldi even allow this? I guess they have helped us so many times we owe them big, but this big? Isn't their space large enough to do it there? Or are the allicrocigators too dangerous and there isn't any space left in their territory?

## USC MILITARY
Rumor has is that the USC military has requested a secret budget of gargantuan proportions. Aren't we a post scarcity society? What could possibly qualify as that? Is this part of the new mandatory service requirements the USC has reinitiated? The Sabra-Fenrir don't mind because they have a 6 year manditory service requirement, but what about the 90% of their populations that are human? That must be what all the construction on Meridian IV is all about.

## AMBASSADOR BARONESS ROCHELLE SABRA
Rumor has it that the Ambassador Baroness Rochelle Sabra has been seen getting herself all dressed up and then taking some private leaves. Has she finally found the man she feels is worthy of her? Who could it be? All the most reasonable eligible bachelors have had their schedules combed through, by envious men who long for her from a distance no doubt, and no one's schedule seems to match her own leaves. People she was cold and distant to have noticed a bit of a thaw, apparently because she doesn't need to keep suitors at bay anymore. It seems to be anyone's guess. Other than the telepaths who probably won't tell. But they know, they know. 

## HARRISON RENHQUIST
Rumor has it that Cmdr Harrison Renhquist has begun dating the Baroness Imogene Sabra. The few times they have been seen in public they have been seen together, sitting at the same table, leaning close, whispering and smiling. The Baroness has never seemed so beautiful as she does in his presence. Wasn't he this crusty old Commander that barked orders at his staff? Wasn't she looking for someone her own age? How did he convince her to even go out with him on the first date? Maybe he isn't just tall, maybe his it big all over.

## ISOBEL DUKE
Rumor has it that Lt Cmdr Isobel Duke has begun spending time on the Bismark since Captain Zoe Cade has taken the assignment. Captain Zoe appears to be assigning only humans, androids, and Conclave members to her crew. Is she going to leave the USS Sequoia and join the crew of the Bismark? Are there others thinking the same thing? Is the reason Captain Cade is not staffing Zendai because she already has Zendai coming from her old ship?

## MARTIN BALSIM
Rumor has that Ensign Martin Balsim has caused a fatal training incident. Did he kill more than one person? Did he kill a recruit? Was it someone of higher rank? He hasn't been seen in the brig, so what kind of punishment will there be for killing someone, even accidentally? Is this why Cmdr Hunter and Cmdr Tzimisce were suddenly called away during other duties?   

## PSICORPS ACADEMY
Rumor has it that the new PSICorps Academy has started training over one hundred new recruits. It appears Olympia, Taranis, Satrine, Ixtana, and Viktoria are rotating in and out as the staff, but since no non-psionic civilian is allowed on campus, no one knows for sure. Where did they get all these candidates? It must have taken months to put something in place to find so many people. How long will it take before these new PSICorps members are in the field? Are they also training psionic civilians? 

## TRIUMVERATE MARQUIS CIRUS SABRA
Rumor has it that the Triumverate Marquis Cirus Sabra has reserved an _entire deck_ of the USC battle station outside the shatterzone. Is this the wedding we have all been told about? Is the fact is it reserved for three days significant like it is for all Sabra social events? Luxury replicators and caterers are all booked up for, well, _something_ the same three days. The real question is if he is indead getting married, who is the lucky bride?

## KEPTRA HOSTAGES
Rumor has it that the Keptra hostages don't seem to believe they are guests. Most seem to believe they are now property, to be used as their conquerers see fit. Only Clan Snake and Clan Pearl seem to understand they are actually diplomats instead of hostages. The Clan Spider hostage tries to be very friendly at every opportunity, but appears afraid of both the other clans and the USC personnel. They are allowed to travel the grounds of their provided estate but not leave without an escort. Clan Snake's hostage is very friendly and well liked.

## KEPTRA EMPRESS
Rumor has it that the Keptra Empress has not been very cooperative. Sure, they could just read her mind, but they have chosen not to so as to gain her trust. It doesn't appear to be working. She demands food, drink, clothing, bathes, makeup, and people to attend to her, but offers nothing in return. She has even demanded that the hostages from the clans be forced to serve her. She doesn't speak of her capture or the war. She won't send messages back to her people. She won't engage in any diplomatic discussions. She acts bored and disinterested when the discussion is about anything but her wants and needs.

## KEPTRA PSIONICS
Rumor has it that among the Keptra hostages are at least three psionics. The information is that one is a precog, one an empath, and one a telepath. The precog doesn't seem to see anything that doesn't involve herself. The telepath seems like a weaker version of our own Viktoria, so there might be some concern if she starts sending instead of just receiving. The empath seems only able to read emotions, being unable to send or manipulate them. The telepath and empath seem very friendly, while the little Clan Fox girl seems happy to be here and very eager to share and learn as much as possible about us "aliens".

## CAPTAIN HALE AND CAPTAIN MARCHANT
Rumor has it that now that Captain Hale and Captain Marchant no longer serve on the same ship, they will have a quick wedding in the very near future. Some people are saying it will be a private affair. Others say it will be public and point to a recent reservation of the battle station's entire observation deck. Some people forsee a very pregnant farship captain in the near future. It is good to see them finally be able to tie the knot.

## TRIUMVERATE MARQUIS CIRUS SABRA
Rumor has it that the Triumverate Marquis Cirus Sabra has finally decided to marry. Is it Marquess Gabor? Countess Tobin? Baroness Karenina? Baroness Ortiz? Someone else? Why the secrecy and why did he wait until after the election?

## SIGMUND BOUND
Rumor has it that the boy wonder was very excited recently about... something? He was heard raving about some nearly impossible task being completed. People wonder if its war related or something else. I guess word will get out soon enough, unless it is top secret or something.

## FAMKE KRUMB
Rumor has it that Ambassador Krumb has begun spending time with Captain Hale. Are her intentions romantic? She would seem to have a good chance since they are both Creasurians. But rumors also have Lt Cmdr Valance making romantic gestures toward the Captain. So far he seems to be treating them equally, being polite and courteous, so it is difficult to figure out what is happening.  

## ADRIANA ASHWOOD AND KLAUS TANNHAUSER
Rumor has it that Cmdr Ashwood has privately married Cmdr Tannhauser with only Captain Cade, Cmdr Marchant, Captain Hale, and Cmdr Soze in attendance. They are both on leave which has led people to suspect they are actually on their honeymoon. Since the captains and commanders won't talk about it, people can only speculate on why they have been so secretive. 

## TELEMACHUS CADE
Rumor has it that Captain Cade enforced the agreement they made when they joined the USC of having the final say in all crew assignments, quashing all transfers of his crew while denying two new crew members out of sixty seven.  

## GREG NOON
Rumor has it that Lt Noon has been reassigned to the USS Zephyr to the objection of Captain Hale, but fight he didn't win. Everyone assumes this is some kind of demotion, which is really strange for one of the hero's of the Drago-Kadzai / Primrose war. 

## CLINT
Rumor has it that Lt Jr "Clint" was suddenly reassigned to Farfleet HQ on Meridian III and Captain Hale became extremely angry, with the final result being Clint was reinstated on the USS Celestia. Why Clint was being moved and what motivated Hale's sudden outburst to keep him remains unknown. 

## ZOE MARCHANT
Rumor has it that Cmdr Marchant is being offered the heavy battlecruiser USS Bismark instead of the now scrapped USS Shiva. She has yet to accept the offer, probably stunned by the cancellation of the USS Shiva. The crew of the USS Sequoia are fully behind her, whatever decision she makes. Feelings are mixed about the cancellation of what could have been the most powerful warship the USC could field.

## OLYMPIA TZIMISCE
Rumor has it that Cmdr Tzimisce is being reassigned to train all the new psionic recruits. Nobody is certain what is going to happen to the PSICorp leadership. Will Satrine, Ixtana, or Viktoria take the reigns? What about the intelligence services? Aren't those split between Security and PSICorps?

## TRANSFER OF POWER
Rumor has it that the USC military has almost completed the process of handing over power to the new civilian goverment, including all military power. With the rumored resource discussions happening in the Five Houses, are we about to see a reduction in the USC military? Maybe a shift from military ship construction to civilian? What new orders for the military will the Triumverates dictate, now that they are in charge? 

## THE RESTORED MONARCHY
Rumor has it that there are some concerns that the Zendai, Carpathian, and Creasurian people are upset that they are automatically out of consideration for the restored Monarchy. If the Monarchy must indeed exclude such large groups of people, can it really be said it will work in their best interests? What if the Empress turns out to be a nobody with the right genes who was once a slave or something? 

## ROGUE PSIONIC PANIC
Rumor has it that the civilian population has been asking USC personnel a lot of questions about rogue or just unknown psionics: their powers, how to identify a psionic, how to know if you have been affected buy a psionic, what weapons and plans the USC has for use against rogue psionics, etc.

## CIRUS SABRA
Rumor has it that the new Triumverate Marquis Cirus Sabra has been secretly seeing someone during his run up to victory. People aren't sure which noble woman he is courting/shagging, but the candidates appear to be fairly limited: Countess Viviene, Countess Sarafina, Ambassador Baroness Rochelle, Baroness Sofie, or Baroness Petra. Because he spent so much time with the Countesses, one of them is a sure bet.

## WILSON CLARK
Rumor has it that the new Triumverate Wilson Clark has already started to push the Five Houses into budgetary and resource discussions regarding the USC Military, which is strange because don't we live in a mostly post-scarcity society? What kind of resource discussions could there be? And for what resource(s)?

## THE ALIEN SISTERS
Rumor has it that Shara's sisters have begun to explore the battle station by themselves, praticing both the Basic and Zendai languages. They don't travel together and seem to prefer different parts of the ship. Kairi likes the cantina and most engineering sections. Tarna likes the cargo holds when ships load and unload, as well as sickbay.

## PRIMUS SABRA
Rumor has it that former Baron Primus Sabra is being kept in a deep dark hole somewhere. No one has heard from or seen him in months or even knows if he is alive. There are also rumors his closest followers and confidants have either also been arrested or they went into hiding.

## IMPERIAL MAJESTY
Rumor has it that the USC already knows who the candidate is for Empress! She must be a human, so all Zendai are out. Because of the genetics involved she is probably a pre-fall human from the USS Celestia or a tiny cluster USC member? Bets are starting to get placed everywhere about who she might be. Hopefully this pool doesn't get ruined like the @&#$€£§∆√%.

## LIEUTENANT RYLAN
Rumor has it that Lt Rylan hasn't been spending his time alone afterall, but has in fact been seeing someone on the down low after making sure he had flowers and Champaign with him during his "alone time"!

## COMMANDER ASHWOOD
Rumor has it that Cmdr Ashwood is now engaged to Commander Tannhauser of the Sequoia. What beautiful babies they are going to make!

## SHARA
Rumor has it that Shara suddenly got all grown up from her naive little girl form and was brave enough to just go visit her family to tell them off about something.

## AMBASSADOR BARONESS ROCHELLE
Rumor has it that the Sabra-Fenrir have chosen Baroness Rochelle to be their official Ambassador. She is currently setting up quarters on the battle station in the diplomatic wing with her personnel and has made it a point to meet with USC command, Dominique, all the other ambassadors, and the crew of the Sequoia. She spent most of her time with Dominique and the crew of the Sequoia.

## AMBASSADOR PORTIA
Rumor has it that the Ventrasii Ambassador Portia abruptly left the observation lounge to walk to the docking ring of an arriving Zendai passenger ship. A man disembarked that she started to shadow. He appeared not to notice her following him a close 2 meters distance. People tried to talk to Portia, who they never before saw just walking around the station, but she would politely excuse herself each time and keep following. He must have been spooked by having people periodically speak to someone he couldn't see or hear, including in the men's rest room, because he made a hasty retreat to the passenger ship without having done whatever it is he came to do and stayed on it until it departed. Portia just returned to the observation lounge as if nothing happened.

## ZOE MARCHANT
Rumor has it that Cmdr Marchant and Captain Cade were supposed to get married once she received her new posting as captain of her own vessel, but they have postponed the wedding since their arrival due to her still being his XO.

## 117 MILLION
Rumor has it that most of the 117 million refugees from the deadly star cluster have lost their ability to reproduce, with those who still can facing a high risk of birth defects, due to the long term effects of the radiation. People outside the 177 million seem to be avoiding getting into any kind of serious relationships with the refugees. 

## PEYTON HUNTER
Rumor has it that Cmdr Peyton Hunter had a long conversation with Baroness Imogene after the party behind closed doors, but no one knows the topic or who initiated the conversation.

## YING-KO
Rumor has it Ying-Ko was stopped moments before he could murder Baron Primus by the Baroness Emesyn. The Imperial Zendai lower ranking crew members seem to approve of his attemptedurder, but understand why he had to be stopped.

## COMMANDER ASHWOOD
Rumor has it Cmdr Ashwood had her ice cold heart melted by Cmdr Tannhauser on the night of the party. They were seen slow dancing cheek to cheek, sitting close together at a table, and leaning in close to whisper and laugh softly to one another. She was seen being a lady; demure in speech and manner, exuding tenderness and frailty, revealing a soft feminine side no one has ever seen before.

## ALIEN VISITORS
Rumor has it the alien visitor guests of the alien Shara discovered the joys of dancing and love making. Kiari seems to have embraced dancing with a lead, being completely submissive, allowing her every action to be controlled by her partner. Tarna seems to have equally embraced lovemaking, being virginal and submissive, allowing her every action to be controlled by her lover. Tarna has received a large number of offers to experience new lovers.

## VENTRASII AMBASSADOR
Rumor has it the Ventrasii Ambassador Portia is as freaky in the sheets as she is in the streets. Her lover, Yeoman Butler, is a changed man who claims his experience with her was like a religious epiphany. She used him in ways that would surprise even the Sabra. He says he never met a woman as experienced, controlling, and with such a dirty mouth. People wonder if she is monogamous or if it was just sex and she is willing to take additional lovers.

## BARON PRIMUS
Rumor has it that Baron Primus groped an old school Zendai junior officer, then ordered her to have sex with him, all while in front of her crew and attendees of the party. He was forced to make a public apology and landed himself in prison for several months. The Marquis is so furious he is considering Revocation of Nobility for the Baron.

## ZENDAI IMPERIALS
Rumor has it that the current Zendai are already trying to latch on to these Imperial Zendai to improve their children's genetic profile. The captain is already taken, but with over 290 candiates its first come first serve.

## SHARA'S GUESTS
Rumor has it that Shara has restricted access to her disc because she has three guests on her ship. Shara and the first two guests seemed to smile and laugh and casually socialize, but this new third guest seems to have Shara stressing out.

## BABY SEX BETTING
Rumor has it that someone is so confident about the sex of the Baron and Baroness babies that they have laid down a SIZABLE bet among several bookmakers across the quadrant.

## SILURIAN THREAT
Rumor has it that there is contention among the senior officers in the USC about when and how to help the currently un-devastated worlds close to the Silurian occupation. Some want to help the closest worlds suffering the most first, while others want to bloody the noses of the lizards because each world they take gives them fleet construction as well as closer proximity to the worlds we saved before them.

## ZENDAI IMPERIALS
Rumor has it that the Imperial Zendai consider most of the current Zendai in the quadrant as "troglodytes", barely worthy of being called Zendai. Publically they seem treat everyone with courtesy and respect, even if they seem a bit distant and reserved to anyone not from their own empire.
