# THINGS OVERHEARD NEAR THE REPLICATOR

## FAMKE KRUMB
Rumor has it that Ambassador Krumb has begun spending time with Captain Hale. Are her intentions romantic? She would seem to have a good chance since they are both Creasurians. But rumors also have Lt Cmdr Valance making romantic gestures toward the Captain. So far he seems to be treating them equally, being polite and courteous, so it is difficult to figure out what is happening.  

## ADRIANA ASHWOOD AND KLAUS TANNHAUSER
Rumor has it that Cmdr Ashwood has privately married Cmdr Tannhauser with only Captain Cade, Cmdr Marchant, Captain Hale, and Cmdr Soze in attendance. They are both on leave which has led people to suspect they are actually on their honeymoon. Since the captains and commanders won't talk about it, people can only speculate on why they have been so secretive. 

## TELEMACHUS CADE
Rumor has it that Captain Cade enforced the agreement they made when they joined the USC of having the final say in all crew assignments, quashing all transfers of his crew while denying two new crew members out of sixty seven.  

## GREG NOON
Rumor has it that Lt Noon has been reassigned to the USS Zephyr to the objection of Captain Hale, but fight he didn't win. Everyone assumes this is some kind of demotion, which is really strange for one of the hero's of the Drago-Kadzai / Primrose war. 

## CLINT
Rumor has it that Lt Jr "Clint" was suddenly reassigned to Farfleet HQ on Meridian III and Captain Hale became extremely angry, with the final result being Clint was reinstated on the USS Celestia. Why Clint was being moved and what motivated Hale's sudden outburst to keep him remains unknown. 

## ZOE MARCHANT
Rumor has it that Cmdr Marchant is being offered the heavy battlecruiser USS Bismark instead of the now scrapped USS Shiva. She has yet to accept the offer, probably stunned by the cancellation of the USS Shiva. The crew of the USS Sequoia are fully behind her, whatever decision she makes. Feelings are mixed about the cancellation of what could have been the most powerful warship the USC could field.

## OLYMPIA TZIMISCE
Rumor has it that Cmdr Tzimisce is being reassigned to train all the new psionic recruits. Nobody is certain what is going to happen to the PSICorp leadership. Will Satrine, Ixtana, or Viktoria take the reigns? What about the intelligence services? Aren't those split between Security and PSICorps?

## TRANSFER OF POWER
Rumor has it that the USC military has almost completed the process of handing over power to the new civilian goverment, including all military power. With the rumored resource discussions happening in the Five Houses, are we about to see a reduction in the USC military? Maybe a shift from military ship construction to civilian? What new orders for the military will the Triumverates dictate, now that they are in charge? 

## THE RESTORED MONARCHY
Rumor has it that there are some concerns that the Zendai, Carpathian, and Creasurian people are upset that they are automatically out of consideration for the restored Monarchy. If the Monarchy must indeed exclude such large groups of people, can it really be said it will work in their best interests? What if the Empress turns out to be a nobody with the right genes who was once a slave or something? 

## ROGUE PSIONIC PANIC
Rumor has it that the civilian population has been asking USC personnel a lot of questions about rogue or just unknown psionics: their powers, how to identify a psionic, how to know if you have been affected buy a psionic, what weapons and plans the USC has for use against rogue psionics, etc.

## CIRUS SABRA
Rumor has it that the new Triumverate Marquis Cirus Sabra has been secretly seeing someone during his run up to victory. People aren't sure which noble woman he is courting/shagging, but the candidates appear to be fairly limited: Countess Viviene, Countess Sarafina, Ambassador Baroness Rochelle, Baroness Sofie, or Baroness Petra. Because he spent so much time with the Countesses, one of them is a sure bet.

## WILSON CLARK
Rumor has it that the new Triumverate Wilson Clark has already started to push the Five Houses into budgetary and resource discussions regarding the USC Military, which is strange because don't we live in a mostly post-scarcity society? What kind of resource discussions could there be? And for what resource(s)?

## THE ALIEN SISTERS
Rumor has it that Shara's sisters have begun to explore the battle station by themselves, praticing both the Basic and Zendai languages. They don't travel together and seem to prefer different parts of the ship. Kairi likes the cantina and most engineering sections. Tarna likes the cargo holds when ships load and unload, as well as sickbay.

## PRIMUS SABRA
Rumor has it that former Baron Primus Sabra is being kept in a deep dark hole somewhere. No one has heard from or seen him in months or even knows if he is alive. There are also rumors his closest followers and confidants have either also been arrested or they went into hiding.

## IMPERIAL MAJESTY
Rumor has it that the USC already knows who the candidate is for Empress! She must be a human, so all Zendai are out. Because of the genetics involved she is probably a pre-fall human from the USS Celestia or a tiny cluster USC member? Bets are starting to get placed everywhere about who she might be. Hopefully this pool doesn't get ruined like the @&#$€£§∆√%.

## LIEUTENANT RYLAN
Rumor has it that Lt Rylan hasn't been spending his time alone afterall, but has in fact been seeing someone on the down low after making sure he had flowers and Champaign with him during his "alone time"!

## COMMANDER ASHWOOD
Rumor has it that Cmdr Ashwood is now engaged to Commander Tannhauser of the Sequoia. What beautiful babies they are going to make!

## SHARA
Rumor has it that Shara suddenly got all grown up from her naive little girl form and was brave enough to just go visit her family to tell them off about something.

## AMBASSADOR BARONESS ROCHELLE
Rumor has it that the Sabra-Fenrir have chosen Baroness Rochelle to be their official Ambassador. She is currently setting up quarters on the battle station in the diplomatic wing with her personnel and has made it a point to meet with USC command, Dominique, all the other ambassadors, and the crew of the Sequoia. She spent most of her time with Dominique and the crew of the Sequoia.

## AMBASSADOR PORTIA
Rumor has it that the Ventrasii Ambassador Portia abruptly left the observation lounge to walk to the docking ring of an arriving Zendai passenger ship. A man disembarked that she started to shadow. He appeared not to notice her following him a close 2 meters distance. People tried to talk to Portia, who they never before saw just walking around the station, but she would politely excuse herself each time and keep following. He must have been spooked by having people periodically speak to someone he couldn't see or hear, including in the men's rest room, because he made a hasty retreat to the passenger ship without having done whatever it is he came to do and stayed on it until it departed. Portia just returned to the observation lounge as if nothing happened.

## ZOE MARCHANT
Rumor has it that Cmdr Marchant and Captain Cade were supposed to get married once she received her new posting as captain of her own vessel, but they have postponed the wedding since their arrival due to her still being his XO.

## 117 MILLION
Rumor has it that most of the 117 million refugees from the deadly star cluster have lost their ability to reproduce, with those who still can facing a high risk of birth defects, due to the long term effects of the radiation. People outside the 177 million seem to be avoiding getting into any kind of serious relationships with the refugees. 

## PEYTON HUNTER
Rumor has it that Cmdr Peyton Hunter had a long conversation with Baroness Imogene after the party behind closed doors, but no one knows the topic or who initiated the conversation.

## YING-KO
Rumor has it Ying-Ko was stopped moments before he could murder Baron Primus by the Baroness Emesyn. The Imperial Zendai lower ranking crew members seem to approve of his attemptedurder, but understand why he had to be stopped.

## COMMANDER ASHWOOD
Rumor has it Cmdr Ashwood had her ice cold heart melted by Cmdr Tannhauser on the night of the party. They were seen slow dancing cheek to cheek, sitting close together at a table, and leaning in close to whisper and laugh softly to one another. She was seen being a lady; demure in speech and manner, exuding tenderness and frailty, revealing a soft feminine side no one has ever seen before.

## ALIEN VISITORS
Rumor has it the alien visitor guests of the alien Shara discovered the joys of dancing and love making. Kiari seems to have embraced dancing with a lead, being completely submissive, allowing her every action to be controlled by her partner. Tarna seems to have equally embraced lovemaking, being virginal and submissive, allowing her every action to be controlled by her lover. Tarna has received a large number of offers to experience new lovers.

## VENTRASII AMBASSADOR
Rumor has it the Ventrasii Ambassador Portia is as freaky in the sheets as she is in the streets. Her lover, Yeoman Butler, is a changed man who claims his experience with her was like a religious epiphany. She used him in ways that would surprise even the Sabra. He says he never met a woman as experienced, controlling, and with such a dirty mouth. People wonder if she is monogamous or if it was just sex and she is willing to take additional lovers.

## BARON PRIMUS
Rumor has it that Baron Primus groped an old school Zendai junior officer, then ordered her to have sex with him, all while in front of her crew and attendees of the party. He was forced to make a public apology and landed himself in prison for several months. The Marquis is so furious he is considering Revocation of Nobility for the Baron.

## ZENDAI IMPERIALS
Rumor has it that the current Zendai are already trying to latch on to these Imperial Zendai to improve their children's genetic profile. The captain is already taken, but with over 290 candiates its first come first serve.

## SHARA'S GUESTS
Rumor has it that Shara has restricted access to her disc because she has three guests on her ship. Shara and the first two guests seemed to smile and laugh and casually socialize, but this new third guest seems to have Shara stressing out.

## BABY SEX BETTING
Rumor has it that someone is so confident about the sex of the Baron and Baroness babies that they have laid down a SIZABLE bet among several bookmakers across the quadrant.

## SILURIAN THREAT
Rumor has it that there is contention among the senior officers in the USC about when and how to help the currently un-devastated worlds close to the Silurian occupation. Some want to help the closest worlds suffering the most first, while others want to bloody the noses of the lizards because each world they take gives them fleet construction as well as closer proximity to the worlds we saved before them.

## ZENDAI IMPERIALS
Rumor has it that the Imperial Zendai consider most of the current Zendai in the quadrant as "troglodytes", barely worthy of being called Zendai. Publically they seem treat everyone with courtesy and respect, even if they seem a bit distant and reserved to anyone not from their own empire.
