### EPISODE 01x22 - Occum's Razor

Massive Dynamic reveals that the Primrose AI is aiding the Drago-Kadzai, forcing the USC to expend their remaining programmable matter and create only four AI servers in the short time they have, hoping that combined with their two deckers they can stand against the AI and prevent it from helping the Drago-Kadzai.

Emesyn, now understanding the true plans of the genius Grand Marshal are a feint against the battle station while the two throne worlds of the Sabra-Fenrir are the true targets, convinces the USC and Sabra-Fenrir forces to make a radically unexpected change in strategy, leading the USC fleet and Sabra-Fenrir fleet to rely on the other to defend their respective home worlds.

Taranis' intelligence on the Souldra give them the answer to their defeat, and the USC uses it in a desperate attempt to request aid from the Ventrasii, who once aided the galaxy against the Souldra at a time when their numbers were too low to affect the war.

Jim, encephalon now fully installed and tested, divides his processing to create parallel command frames for use against the Drago-Kadzai and for the Sabra-Fenrir in the upcoming battle at the Sabra-Fenrir throne world.

At the start of battle the USC fleet pretends to flee the quantum eraser equipped Drago-Kadzai fleet by entering the Djinn Star Cluster, only to re-emerge outside Drago-Kadzai sensor range and rush to the Sabra-Fenrir throne world.

The four USC AI's and their deckers begin the assault on the Primrose AI, using the analysis of Massive Dynamic as a starting point to track it down, only to have it fully reveal itself as it attempts to help Drago-Kadzai win the war by conquering ships and disabling entire planets.

The USC fleet lies in wait in the planetary magnetic pole of the throne world, and once the drago-Kadzai fleet appears they go to work with Jim conquering hull type after hull type, venting each ship's crew and firing their death bolts, then switching control back to the Sabra-Fenrir fleet to protect them from the control attempts of the Primrose AI.

At the USC Battle Station the battle begins badly for the USc base, Sabra-Fenrir, and Chigru forces, until the suggestion by Taranis to request the help of the Ventrasii to defend the one group with a weapon to defeat the Souldra pays off, and the Ventrasii repeat history by stepping up and revealing the might of their new fleet and technologies, utterly dominating the battle front and destroying the powerful pre-fall ships, while Emesyn has Massive Dynamic disable the fleeing Drago-Kadzai and greatly improving the USC's relationship with the Chigru.

With the Primrose AI unable to affect the battle, Jim takes control of the entire Drago-Kadzai fleet, wiping out all but a single fleeing ship and capturing the Grand Marshal. His apparently effortless surprise defeat and extreme callousness in executing the crews during the battle has earned him the Zendai name "Ying Ko".

Massive Dynamic played a significant role leading up the battle with its existing infrastructure and detailed intelligence, but intially struggled against the Primrose AI even with the USC AIs and deckers attacking it.

The Primrose AI had potent and effective black ice arsenals and began the war in a winning position, but the strong and steady attacks by the USC AIs and seemingly random and chaotic attacks by the USC deckers at first just slowed, then began to push back against it.

Massive Dynamic was completely ineffective and suffered massive corruptions and deletions across whole worlds by the Primrose AI, with the USC team doubting they could save it. 

At 13.7 seconds into the battle Massive Dynamic fell silent. 

The USC teamed grimaced at the loss of the expert system but continued their attacks and counter attacks. The Primrose AI began to use hired forces against them and their real world infrastructure and the war began it's swing back towards the Primrose AIs favor. 

Massive Dynamic was not sentient, it was not creative, and it was not driven by any motivation other than it's directives. Massive Dynamic was what it was built to be, an expert learning and management machine built to ensure the survival of it's company, products, manufacturing, and market share. AIs spent their cycles on sentience processing, emotional processing and simulation, goal priority weight analysis and processing, and other AI functions too numerous to mention but necessary for them to function as AIs. Massive Dynamic wasn't any of those things. 

What Massive Dynamic was, was a hyper optimized hyper intelligent expert system.

8.1 seconds after it went dark Massive Dynamic roared back to life inside one of the Primrose AIs heavily fortified server farm bunkers. Sacrifcing server farm after server farm during the initial assault Massive Dynamic had applied it's competitive market analysis expert processing system into analyzing real world nano-second skirmishes for the purpose of detecting the computational patterns in the Primrose AI as if the battle were market conditions. Once it discovered exploitable behaviors it began a massive wave of exploits all while continuing to discover additional cascading exploitable behaviors and added them to the assault exploits. 

The pure hyper intelligence system tore through the advanced sentient AI system, each compute cycle allowing it to bring greater numbers of more powerful exploits to bear. The speed of it's operation surprised and shocked even the powerful USC team. 

Moments after the Primrose AI fell, Massive Dynamic displayed a comparison between the USC AIs and the Primrose AI and it's exploitable code to Emesyn. With no ego or self awareness it simply returned to it's previous tasks as if nothing happened. 

Massive Dynamic systems returned across all worlds in a matter of hours.
