# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INVASION
The AI invasion includes several FWA AIs who have decided biologicals can coexist with them but only on their terms.

# CHIGRU INVASION
The Chigru invasion will begin with the Chigru indicating their acknowledgement of all USC territory and claiming all remaining territory as their own.

# GORN INVASION
The GORN invasion will begin as a slow (trans warp) march across space towards all other spaces. These will be led by their colossal beings (code named TITANS) the size of small moons. These creatures can manipulate gravity on a grand scale, effecting jump, hyperdrive, HSFG, warp, trans-warp, lightfold, quantum, slipstream, quantum-slipstream, and lower level hyperspace manifold drives and engines.

The full scale invasion will begin around 03x16 and last until the season finale.

# MISSION INTO MANIFOLD VOID
There are areas in Richard's maps without stars. The maps on the ships contain all the known ares that manifold ships can fly. The dark areas are areas where the manifold engines do not work reliably. Additionally, the communication system Richard uses is an expression of manifold technology and also fails to function.
