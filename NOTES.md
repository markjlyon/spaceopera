# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INVASION
The AI invasion includes several FWA AIs who have decided biologicals can coexist with them but only on their terms.

# CHIGRU INVASION
The Chigru invasion will begin with the Chigru indicating their acknowledgement of all current USC territory and claiming all remaining territory as free range.

They will use their new hiliner ships to stage massive attacks on worlds turning star system after star system into farms.

They leave USC worlds alone, unless the USC attempts to add as a new world a world the Chigru are already attacking or have already claimed, in which case they will point out that taking a Chigru world ends the Red Book.

The worst part is their luxurious resorts where they offer anyone respite, but since they are in Chigru space, then they will harvest some of the guests without USC interference. They do not harveat everyone as they need a fantastic reputation to keep them fully booked. They carefully monitor guests and only loners and those that won't be missed are harvested.

# GORN INVASION
The GORN invasion will begin as a slow (trans warp) march across space towards all other spaces. These will be led by their colossal beings (code named TITANS) the size of small moons. These creatures can manipulate gravity on a grand scale, effecting jump, hyperdrive, HSFG, warp, trans-warp, lightfold, quantum, slipstream, quantum-slipstream, and lower level hyperspace manifold drives and engines.

The full scale invasion will begin around 03x16 and last until the season finale.

To destroy as many USC worlds as possible pregnant "carriers" will swim to different star systems and drop of "larva". These larva move at a speed of 12. It is impossible to target or attack them beyond a range of 6. Due to their incredible natural stealth and FTL agility, direct fire weapons can only be fired if within a range of 6, but they are treated as if they are 6 hexes farther away for hit and damage calculations. Overloaded weapons cannot hit them at all. Seeking weapons must be fired at them within a range of 6 and if they get farther than a range of 6 they lose their target. The larva always move towards a planet if possible. If seeking weapons, shuttles, fighters, or PFs enter their hex they will destroy them automatically on a d6 5-6. If the are hit by direct fire weapons, instead of moving towards a planet they will automatically "jump" and damage each target  that harmed them once that impulse before returning to the starting jump position and continuing. These "jumps" can cause seeking weapons to lose their target if the range exceeds 6. This damage bypasses armor, deflectors, shields, and PA panels. Each attack scores 2d6 damage. To kill them, you must score at least 200 damage. Once it has taken 200 damage, and for each impulse after that it takes 10 or more damage, roll a d6. On a roll of a 1 the larve is killed. Gorn larve are immune to plasma and plasmatic damage.

# MISSION INTO MANIFOLD VOID
There are areas in Richard's maps without stars. The maps on the ships contain all the known areas that manifold ships can fly. The dark areas are areas where the manifold engines do not work reliably. Additionally, the communication system Richard uses is an expression of manifold technology and also fails to function.
